"I'm facing the battery issue. They said that the battery got deep discharge and they are telling me that I have to replace it with a new battery which cost around 60-70k. 

After some chit chat they told me that we can bear 50% cost of battery and you have to give 50%. I agreed to that so they did some paper work on which they wrote 50% and then wrote the amount which is 20,000. Exactly the day after tomorrow which is today they reached out to me via call "" your ola scooter is ready we had one battery already on our centre you can come and take your scooter"" and also one guy from the service centre told me that ola battery cost just dropped down 2 days ago.

Also I noticed that when we were doing the paper work one guy from the service centre was confirming 50%? really? customer agreed? and the other guy nodded him.

I feel like they just repaired the battery somehow or they are replacing it with the old battery and asking 20k for nothing. Feels like a scam to me."
"I have been a bit busy with some personal stuff so I wasn't able to post updates. And I probably will be busy for the next month. If anyone has any new info, articles, hands-on experience, second-hand experience about the Ola scooters please do share. 

We have recently crossed 70 members. Please share this subreddit with others on other social media. Especially with the numerous issues with the scooter and the company as a whole shaping every media story to suit them, I feel it very important we consumers have good communication with each other

The last info I received was that the final purchase window was opening soon

So please share any info you receive, the status of you're order, if you cancelled, why you did it etc. 

As always, take care

Cheers!"
"First of all, don't worry, your scooter is waterproof!

The Ola Scooter and the portable charger come equipped with an Auto Cut-Off feature, which shuts off charging once the battery reaches 100% charge.

Ola Scooters are designed to be charged with Ola's portable charger or at any Ola Hypercharger Station which will be set-up in over 400 cities across the country, with 100,000+ charging points.

Ola's portable charger has inbuilt surge protection of up to 6KV (for a few microseconds). It can handle a majority of scenarios related to voltage fluctuation. Even if voltage fluctuation goes beyond 6KV, the charger will automatically shut down. 
Now that's power!

Ola's Hyperchargers and portable chargers are designed with IP rating of IP55 and IP67 respectively; which means, come rain or snow, you can charge your scooter to the fullest! (Unless there's a blackout)

The Ola S1 Pro requires approximately 3.97KWh of electricity to get fully-charged, which means 3.97 units of electricity give you 181 km of range. The Ola S1 requires approximately 2.98KWh of electricity to get fully-charged, which means 2.98 units of electricity give you 121 km of range."

2. Ola Electric app: Do it all. Lock and unlock your scooter, check the charging status and range, pick a ride mode and much more - all from your smartphone!

3. Vehicle Intelligence: The Ola Scooter auto-locks and unlocks based on how far or close you are to it. It also has Charging Notifications, Range Alerts, Get Home Mode, Cruise Control, Take Me Home Lights and a Find My Scooter feature.

4. Security Features: These include, Geofencing, Anti-theft Alert, and Vehicle Safety and Security Alerts.

5. Infotainment Features: Now play your music, check your messages and answer your calls, all from your Ola Scooter.

6. Cruise Control and Hill Hold features are available only on Ola S1 Pro.

"The Ola Scooter comes fitted with extra-wide 12 inch tyres (110/70-12) both in the front and rear.

What do you think?"
Please post any youtube reviews/first looks of ola scooter here
"Last night was one of the scariest experiences of my life. I was riding my Ola S1 X+ with my friend on our way to a friend's wedding when the scooter suddenly stopped working in the middle of a dark, desolate road. It was pitch black, and we were completely stranded with no help in sight.

I had to remove the fuse, put it back again, and restart the scooter multiple times just to get it to work temporarily. Despite all the effort, we couldn’t rely on it, so I had to call a friend to come pick us up. It was an absolute nightmare. 

Since day one, my experience with the Ola S1 X+ has been nothing short of horrible. Frequent issues, no reliable support, and to make matters worse, Ola refuses to refund or exchange the scooter. It’s like buying an invitation to disaster.

If you're thinking of buying an electric scooter, please buy anything but an Ola. Learn from my experience and save yourself the frustration and danger.

#OlaElectric #ScooterReview #DisasterWaitingToHappen"
"I am planning to buy a scooter under 1L and Ola X1 seems the perfect option
Tho I am a little hesitant because of reviews of poor quality, ola scooters burning, software glitches and bad after sales service. 
How much of this is true and can ola owner or ev owners in general share their experience on mileage, battery detoriation and safety? 
Thanks"
"I'm yet to receive a message from ola that the scooter is available for booking. I have also tried uninstalling and re-installing the Ola App as suggested by people on Twitter but to no avail. 

Also, where are people discussing the issues related to booking? I didn't find much discussion going on in Reddit or Team-Bhp except Twitter. Is there any forum like it is there for Ather?


Edit: Thank you. Finally, the option was enabled.
 
But ultimately didn't book. 

I had reserved a slot on the first day itself but was not interested in booking because of the unavailability of portable batteries.  A friend of mine  was interested and we thought will book for him but ultimately with the delay and so many glitches (Road tax was showing as 15K, delivery was dec end) he also lost interest and decided to wait for official reviews to come."
"Firstly, a thankyou to this forum as well as all the people I DMed and their quick responses on my random (read noob) queries :D

Review of sorts will follow after this 'journey' paragraph! 

Didn't how to ride a bike up until November. Wanted a bike since 2018 but simply wouldn't get it for various reasons. Have Lord Activa since 2009 though! 

Started serious research May/June 2023, had my eyes on:
MT-15
TVS Ronin
H'ness

Then, in September/October got to know about CB300R and immediately fell in love with the neo-retro looks. Research went on, took a test drive, and my oh my, the sheer acceleration was scary, the goood scary. However, it was just a 5 mins ride and yet I basically finalized it. 

Then, wanted a test drive of Duke250 too, loved the design, the metal tank as well as the finish and console! Dealership had no test drive available even after waiting for a month. 

Did hell lot of research on accessories for CB300R, parts availability and what not! 16th Jan I was going to the dealership to book and sign the papers. 
Then came the news that Vit250 and Svart250 have been launched with updated design! 

Was always a fan of these Swedish machines however the saddle height never let me consider it test riding it let alone buying (5'7 with added disadvantage of inseam) 
Now, with bigger bike, better console and lowered seat height  immediately made me reconsider my decision for CB (I know many people love the earlier pure cafe racer look of it). 

Enough story time, so booked it 2 weeks back, got it last week and here I am :) 

Pros:
1. Looks (subjective, however can't deny it does look pretty) 
2. Low RPM exhaust note
3. Buttons are tactile
4. Headlight seems good (rode 5ish KMs in the dark) 
5. Suspensions are okay (my reference point is Ola scooter and activa, so take it with a grain of salt) 
6. Console info is good

Cons:
1. Engine heating? (Is it normal?, max temp I've seen is 97) 
I can feel heat on my thighs and knees
2. Idk why but handlebar looks very little tilted to left while riding (now this again can be my posture, seems perfect on standstill) 
3. Quite short gear ratios so 1st/2nd shift is quite often (I knew this beforehand) but since very new didn't know how often actually it will be) 
4. Husqvarna website earlier had mentioned officially that Bluetooth connectivity is there. For a month or so, was on their page, it is NOT there and I guess recently they removed it. 
5. Of course no extra market accessories yet. 

Others:
1. Haven't tested mileage properly, console shows 27 as of now. 
Mostly rode in city and normal traffic conditions 

More updates and pictures with better background should be coming soon. 
Until then ask away!"
"I have test drived ola s1 air , chetak urbane, aether 450s . All three had 1.3~ lakh onroad price . I really liked riding ola but due to the reviews I chose chetak . Because chetak without tecpac is still usable while aether without propack is unusable. But today ola got a price drop . So I am again confused.

Is ola scooters that bad? Especially the current gen?"
"Even if it doesn't have any defects, it looks gayish."
"Recently my sibling bought ola s1 x+ and within 2 month of use, it started having problems like display turning fully off when driving and all. So we raised a ticket and the appointment date was 8 days later available in our locality. The issues were fixed but after a week a new problem has occurred where we can’t use any buttons due to which the scooter doesn’t start and the guy at ola service is refusing to take a look at it saying get an appointment first and appointment isn’t available in our locality in next 7-8 days. I’m thinking of going there and having an argument with the service guy. What else can i do to speed up this?"
"Hi
I was riding my OLA scooter (S1X+). yesterday and suddenly the scooter died - the screen went off and the power also went off.

I was not able to start the vehicle again.

Has anyone faved something like this?

Is there anything i cold so to aolve this?"
I’m starting college in a bit and i needed something to get around. Daily commute is around 30 km and maybe 20 extra going to meet friends and what not. Needless to say i’ll need a fair mileage and preferably a little sporty. Friends suggested the MT-15 and it’s sporty twin but im not a fan of either. And owing to my size i feel that i’d be looking big on the the MT.
"Just what the title says. budget is 1.5Lakh. Looking to buy it for my mother and myself. I just know NOT to buy OLA scooter.

Looking for daily commute as well as long commute sometimes. 

Things that i am looking for with priority:

1. Good Servicing & customer care.
2. No unnecessary trouble.
3. Battery should be good & should charge fully over night.
4. Good range? ( daily commute is fine )

Any suggestion will be helpful."
"Got my CB350 Delivered this evening, after months of consideration, test rides and reddit discussions. Thanks a lot folks for clearing out my doubts!

Bigger challenge ahead: Sending my Ola Scooter 3000 kms away."
"Bro got butthurt  when LinkedIn took his post about pronouns down. Now he wants all Indians who didn't have much of a problem with Microsoft owned LinkedIn to boycott it. Zoho founder too has joined hands with him as they think MS is a bully. 

He's a Jai Shankar of the Corporate. 

After Ola scooters and Krutrim AI that is gonna take on Chatgpt( :P), bro might have OLA OS as a  replacement for Windows."
https://twitter.com/SamkitP21/status/1617034354437545985?t=WzmULliZ7NESOtyAaQ-sJg&s=19
Mine just stops working even when it has 50% of charging left.
"I have bought an ola scooter which is to be delivered by 3rd week of July. Today I received a call from some number asking for FAME-II OTP. I feared that it's a scam call and immediately cut the call (heard so many times about OLA OTP scam). Now they called me again, I just asked why should I even believe this call is genuine? They talked something about Pan card and something. My panic mode immediately struck and I immediately cut my phone. Now they repeatedly called, like 7-8 times. I just switched off my phone out of fear of being scammed. 

If someone has bought one from ola or knows anything, please help."
OLA Service issue. Customers are kings and they will decide the fate of the company.
"My investment philosophy is a mix of being contranian, and allow a bit of risk when the reward is high. I don't believe in doing too much research, because there's no way you can predict a success like Zomato. You can just hypothesize and hope for the best. Reasons for investing in Ola Electric:

1. Electric 2W make way more sense electric cars in India (since distance covered are short) and we are still early in the transition.
2. It's possible that EV complaints for Ola scooters are overblown or[ they will address it with time](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/ola-electric-customer-complaints-issue-ccpa-to-probe-ola-electrics-99-complaint-resolution-claim-452044-2024-10-30).
3. Ola electric has the highest market share and a decent product portfolio. They can go very well from here.

So, in a few months, Ola Electric can either fall down quite a bit if they lose market share and fail to regain trust of customers. Or, they can reach their old highs and go even further than that if they maintain their market dominance.

Happy to take this bet."

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**

  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  
**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28."
"I don't defend OLA but why so much hate?
Yes its a startup there will be bad products and there will be hickups. Then just don't buy their product.

On kunal kamra controversy, bhavish is just saving his company's image by defending it. Yes he will make noise thats what is called promotion to create hype, create publicity. But why are we abusing him many people were making money after ipo for quite sometime.

To those who are showing falling stockprice of Ola. Market is all red so i don't think ola is at fault, it was all market hype which increased ola's stock price the price is still at IPO level (if not above it considering market is all bearish)

I think there is a direct comparison to Chetan Bhagat, his novels are not that good but you cannot  deny they are simple reads. Yes they have p*rn but only a small part of it (so do bollywood). But many people hate him so much? Why they hate him? Just don't read him likewise don't buy OLA scooter. Use ola app its ok in my opinion gets the job done. As a CEO he has made OLA (app) sucessful, he might not have it in him to build a electric vehicle brand so be it. He will fail, just don't buy ola scooter. But most people are buying it even after so much news of fire and what not.
Given he has made a copy of a cab hailing app he is again trying to copy the electric vehicle brand by copying Elon Musk. He is intelligent in my opinion because certainly his trick is working because at the end no publicity is bad publicity. Elon Musk was getting so much hate when he bought Twitter amd i don't think it bothers anyone now.

Here are just my two cents just opinion no support to ola.

At the end haters yahi reh jayenge usko traction aur publicity de kr and vo udhar paisa bana lega imo."
"If you ask Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar  Sharma, he'll tell you that this isn't the best time for a startup to go public. However, there is never a bad time to approach VCs for funding.

Bhavish Agarwal, co-founder, and CEO of Ola, just posted a.png file on Twitter that appears to be a render of an electric car.

Since Bhavish's post, Ola Electric has raised 11.8k likes, 1258 retweets, and 1243 comments.

Ask Elon Musk what's better than going into the car manufacturing industry. Despite the fact that he was sleeping on factory floors and was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy twice. But the good memes eventually paid off, and Tesla is now a trillion-dollar company.

Bhavish immediately responded when many business experts advised him to focus on his Ola scooter issues first. ""These petrol journalists are terrified of our Twitter likes my electric car got,"" he said.

VCs are apparently debating whether or not to fund Ola's electric car project until the tweet receives at least 50k likes on Twitter.

"1. The Stock hit a high of 3584 at Feb 16 2021 and is now trading at 2485/share which is a fall of more than 30% from ATH.
2. The YoY sales growth has decreased by 10% . The decrease in sales can be attributed to  regulatory changes in emission norms, rise in Petrol price and people opting for Electric bikes instead.
3. As per estimates, I expect even more decrease in sales due to price hike of raw materials and fear of Omnicron variant which might cause a bad look in its P/L statement. But as investors, we have to remember that a company is valued depending on its growth and Hero Motocorp has a huge value to be unlocked - ""E2W market"".
4. Right now, Ola electric is likely to dominate the E2W market in 2023 because of its gigafactory in TamilNadu that will produce 1 crore ola scooters/year which will likely put the numbers produced by its competetors Okinawa, Ampere and Hero Electric to shame.
5. By creating 1 crore E2W's per year, this will cause a massive spike in charging infrastructures in Metropolitican hubs like Delhi, Banglore, Chennai, Calcutta that can be easily exploited by Hero Motocorp as the present market leader.
6. As of today, Aether motocorp which is backed by Hero Motocorp is creating its second manufacturing factory in Tamilnadu that will create 4 lakh E2W vehicles per year. Adding it with inhouse production of E2W Splendor from March 2022, Hero motocorp has a huge possibility to become #2 Market leader in E2W space within 2025. 
7. These factors can easily make the stock rise to its previous ATH of 3584 giving investors a profit of 44% in the next few years."
"About: Ather and Ola are Indian companies manufacturing electric vehicles. I own an Ather and I'm interested in knowing what data is collected from the vehicle and how to evade from that. 

As a privacy enthusiast and an advocate, I'm interested in learning about the data collection practises of electric vehicles.
Given that Ather and Ola are the most popular electric vehicles in the country, I've learnt that they collect a ton of data about you.

Like, I've an Ather, and it has 46+ sensors installed onto the vehicle and I've no idea about what sensor collect what data and where does it share, I cannot control the internet in the vehicle, it is always connected to the internet, I cannot block the network access unless I shut it down. The same is with the Ola scooters as well.

(I was able to block the telemetry from the app just because I can control it, not the vehicle. I physically own it, not virtually.)

I tried searching about this on the internet and I'm astonished by the fact that I couldn't find, not even a single post or an article that addresses this privacy issue in these electric vehicles.
Yes, in the ather forum, I was lucky enough to find a thread addressing my concerns but all the questions went unanswered.

I'm pretty sure that your live location is being shared with the company 24/7. I want to know more because I'm concerned. As a user, I've paid for the vehicle means I should own it. It is not that the OEM is supposed to be taking care of the vehicle. Of course it should, but it has its own limits and I, the user should be the decider and not the company.

P.S: I could only find 2 privacy policies. One on their website which talks about the data practices on the website. Another is regarding the app that talks about data practices on the app. Both of them are horrible in their own way. However, I could no where find a privacy policy for the vehicle (Ather 450x, to be specific)."
"Hello All , I have already put up a distress message on the St. Broseph south bangalore chapter , so hopefully they will help me with this issue. If you spot a Gray (anthracite) color vehicle with number KA \*\* EU 1411 , please inform me of the same.   
It will likely be somewhere in HSR layout , but at this point I have no clue.

On Monday morning I noticed that My OLA scooter was no longer in my ground floor parking garage but Gone . Missing. 

I panicked and have already lodged FIR with the police.  
The OLA scooter details are clearly visible on my ola app but I am unable to retrace it. My scooter is insured so I will try and contact OLA scooter helpline for help as well.

Please be a bit vigilant , Bangalore city , in helping me get my scooter back as my livelihood depends on me being able to shuttle to and fro , from my workplace , on a daily basis.

Please be of help"
"I  bought ola 8 months ago, due to personal reasons had to travel out of the city and put it in vacation mode when the battery was around 30%. Could only return after two months. Due to which the scooter got deep discharged. I was not aware this would happen, now they're charging close to 90k for battery replacement, as it can't be repaired. There was one auto generated call from ola which I didn't pick assuming it was spam call in that period.  During purchase the sales person had told put it in vacation mode but didn't mention anything about the deep discharge. 

Even towing experience to the service centre is so bad.  The folks in service centre are so overloaded that they don't pick up the calls and it was one of the worst service centre experiences I had ever been. I don't blame the service centre guys but looks like they're under staffed. 

This post is just for venting my frustration and you don't do the mistake I did. 


summary : ola scooter battery got deep discharged and there's no way to fix it, it has to be replaced.



*Update: Ola replaced my battery without cost, so thank my luck for that. However it ook close to 1.5 months.*"
"I faced a terrifying and unprovoked attack today while driving on Vibgyor High School Road in Bangalore. This seems like a planned attack to extort money.

Summary of the incident:

* A grey Ola scooter (KA 03 KU 6880) randomly overtook my car.
* The rider followed me, yelling and shouting, then obstructed my way.
* He picked up a coconut shell and smashed my window multiple times.
* A grey Renault Triber (KA 04 MW 2000) also tried to block my way further ahead.

Thankfully, I had a dashcam and recorded the entire incident. BLR Police reached out and shared that there's some update on the case. Filing a formal complaint soon.

More details, footage and real-time updates on Twitter - [https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761](https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761)

I hope things get better and more livable in this beautiful city.

PS: Unsolicited advice to all car owners, please install dual-channel dash-cam in your car ASAP. This is like paying for an insurance policy.

Update: The scooter guy is apprehended. Details here - [https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761](https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761)"
"Day before yesterday was my First day i spent in Bangalore as an adult , i have been here before when i was 14.

Now i felt i need a change in my life , so i wanted to move to Bangalore , so i came to look for jobs and give my cv.

I felt the city so energetic , every person around were so wholesome. Everyone around me were happy and smiling , i was so much excited to be in Bangalore.

So much youngsters from various parts of the nation , the culture was unique i travelled whole day in Bus only from Marathahalli to Malleswaram , Then to Bommasandra , Then to Bileshivale and back to Marathahalli

I got to meet many people and had  wholesome conversations with local uncles 

And the bus conducter marked that she didnt give 5 rs change , i thought its like a coupon so i can get discount in next bus but other conducter didnt even respond me when i asked.

Weather was so nice that day compared to my place , and finding the bus in majestic was hard too .

I went back to pg after tiring travel and slept peacefully , 


Second day i had an interview and i went , and to my surprise even security person was so fluent in english , we became good friends.

Later that day i had my train , my friend took me to a kerala restaurant in bellandur , i had to carry my trolley on my lap, sitting as a pillion.
 
I had my train at K.R.Puram , my friend didnt know routes properly , he missed the u turn and we went over benniganahalli bridge , we went close to 3 kms for the U turn

While returning back from there i never realised my day is going to face a u turn , from all the happy faces , joyful vibes of bangalore amidst the traffic.

My friend was guilty of not knowing the routes and i might have missed my train because of it , so he panicked a bit.

He was filtering through the traffic and when finally when we reached an open strech......

My trolley's wheel which i was holding on my lap , hit on an ola scooter person's handle
I realised it was about to hit and i tried to move it a little , but still it hit his hand , i waved him telling a sorry.

But that man was furious , he started chasing animatedly , screaming at us , my friend didnt realise it until i told him the situation.

That person came close to us and showered hindi bad words at us thinking we are north indian , but iam tamil

My friend slowed down the bike to speak and the person tried to push us down , we lost balance somehow my friend managed and stopped 

That person stepped down screaming at my friend and tried to slap him , i intervened and 
told him it was my fault , but he was not ready to listen 

He was so anxious that he might have died , but that was not so bad of a collision , it was minor , and he tried to tell in tamil to us that he have kids and family.

I understood his emotion and felt bad and also realised the psychological effect of being in so much traffic , ROAD RAGE.

He exaggerated the situation so much out of the anxiety i think.

And i my friend was so pissed and had a thought its common in bangalore when riding with Tamilnadu registered vehicle , which i have heard in many incidents 

But this was not like that and explained my friend not to have such a negative mindset which makes us feel insecure .

That person left and later i realised it was not the trolley wheel which hit his handle, it was my hand and i stumbled on that man's brake handle and i was bleeding.

We reached K.R.Puram station after all the hassle , we had a cup of tea and we were happy that we didnt escalate the problem . 

We both were so raged at the beginning wanted to fight that person , as that man confronted us when it was him who came and hit my hand , 

But during the arguement i realised that person was unaware of what happened , even i was not sure what happened all of a sudden

And my advice to anyone facing such issue dont plan to fight , just let them vent out verbally and leave, its better than arguing or fighting the person , which is not worth it

After having two contrasting days , i left the city with a smile .

Once i get some vacancy in job i will move.

I wanted to share my experience , and would love to hear similar situations , and how you faced it ?"
"* Ather has low range for my requirement. they will start to make it atleast 100 range I'll be first in line.
* TVS iQube checks lot of boxes but fails in Range and man feels like they intentionally made an inferior product just because they don't want to hurt their Jupiter sales. Charging time 7 hr are you kidding?
* Ola scooter: Don't want to be their unpaid beta tester 
* Hero electric is a Joke so much potential lost!!
* Others: Imported plastic body kits paired with retrofitting ev motor no underseat space to keep helmet

Feels like i should put off buying an ev for atleast 2 more years"
"I wonder if anyone else got the Ola EV scooter delivered to Mumbai?

I haven't seen a single Ola Scooter on-road in Mumbai yet."
"I purchased a $400 QP of Cherry Pie.. and got sent 4x $50 ounces of the most micro buds ever.. the smell was terrible, almost the exact same profile scent of a bug repellent spray.. reached out to customer service and they are a joke.. after going back and forth for a week.. I received a $75 STORE CREDIT LOL. 

Note: I did some research on the company, watched reviews on YouTube and of course, reddit.. which leads me to believe most of the comments are bots and the ""jk ambassadors"" are paid quite well to lie about the flower."

"I wanted to share my thoughts on the Walking Yoga app after using it for a couple of months. Honestly, I hesitated to write this because I know there are a lot of fitness apps out there that promise a lot but don’t really deliver. I’ve been trying to find a balance in my routine while managing stress after moving to another state, so I was looking for something that combined my love for walks with mindfulness and yoga practice.

It’s not exactly cheap (31$/month) so when I first heard about the app, I was quite hesitant, but I figured it was worth a shot if it could help me refine my routine. Then I got 51% off and immediately grabbed it. I appreciate how the app integrates walking and yoga without feeling forced and I found I started adding short sessions into my day like a quick walk followed by a few yoga stretches. It’s not groundbreaking, but it’s nice to have it laid out for me, especially on days when I feel down and disregulated.

The habit building feature caught my attention. It encourages you to make these practices part of my daily life, which is something I struggle with. I have to say, it’s nice to have reminders to take a breather and be mindful. I mean I still wonder if I could achieve the same results without paying for the app, but it’s actually good.

Now I’ll be honest this app isn’t an instant solution. It requires time and consistency. Some of the exercises can feel repetitive, and if you’re looking for overnight results, you might end up feeling disappointed.

That said, I’ve noticed some improvements in my flexibility and my overall mood in 2weeks. It’s hard to ignore that feeling

Overall, I think the app has its merits, especially for those of us who need a little push to stay committed to our routines. Just go in with realistic expectations this isn’t a magic fix, but it can be helpful."

This isn't just a manufacturer's claim – I've verified this through multiple test sessions. The extended flight time transforms the experience from a brief novelty into hours of genuine entertainment.

One of the most frustrating aspects of flying toys is waiting for them to charge. The [**Cosmic Globe**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/) solves this with its rapid 15-minute charging system. This quick turnaround means less downtime and more playtime, especially during family gatherings or outdoor events.

"[**TLDR**:](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/) After spending three months testing the authentic [**Cosmic Globe**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/#fullreview) and reading countless galaxy ball reviews, I'm sharing my complete experience with this viral floating orb. While many galaxy ball reviews seem overly promotional, I wanted to provide an honest, hands-on perspective about [**what really works (and what doesn't)**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/). If you're short on time, here's the quick takeaway: [**it's worth the investment if you buy the genuine product**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/), but there's a learning curve that most reviews don't mention.

https://i.redd.it/rsj7xy4t257e1.gif

# [**Why I Decided to Test It**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

Like many parents, I first encountered the Cosmic Globe through my kids' persistent pleading. They came home from school one day, buzzing with excitement about this ""amazing floating ball"" their friend had brought to recess. Initially, I was skeptical - I've seen enough galaxy ball reviews online to know that viral products often disappoint. However, after watching dozens of videos and reading through countless galaxy ball reviews, my curiosity got the better of me. Plus, anything that might get my three kids away from their screens seemed worth investigating.

https://i.redd.it/iysvxm4u257e1.gif

# [**The Real Deal vs. Knockoffs (A Critical Warning)**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

Here's something that most galaxy ball reviews don't emphasize enough: the market is absolutely flooded with counterfeits. After accidentally ordering a fake one first (yes, I fell for it), I learned to spot the differences. The authentic Cosmic Globe has several key distinguishing features that knockoffs can't replicate.

First, there's the build quality. The genuine article uses a specialized flex material that gives it just the right amount of bounce without compromising durability. Counterfeits typically use cheaper plastics that crack easily. The authentic version also features true 45-minute flight time - I've tested this repeatedly with a stopwatch, unlike many galaxy ball reviews that just repeat manufacturer claims.

You'll also find an official holographic security sticker and registered serial number on legitimate units. The LED system is notably different too - knockoffs often have harsh, flickering lights, while the real Cosmic Globe produces smooth, professional-grade illumination that's actually pleasant to look at.

# [**Performance Testing Results: Three Months of Daily Use**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

While conducting my own tests and comparing them to other galaxy ball reviews, I discovered that most reviews barely scratch the surface of what this device can actually do. Let me break down my comprehensive findings from three months of daily testing with my family.

The battery life genuinely impressed me. Unlike cheaper alternatives that die within minutes, the authentic Cosmic Globe delivers on its promised 45-minute flight time - I've verified this repeatedly with different use patterns. What's even more remarkable is the charging speed. The 15-minute quick charge isn't just marketing speak; I've timed it consistently. Plug it in during a snack break, and it's ready for another full session.

The USB-C compatibility means you can charge it with pretty much any modern charger, though I recommend using the included cable for optimal results. There's a smart battery indicator system that uses color-coded lights to show remaining power: green for full charge, yellow for medium, and red when you've got about 5 minutes left. After over 500 charge cycles during my testing period, I haven't noticed any significant battery degradation.

Flight performance is where the Cosmic Globe truly shines. The 45-meter range claim is actually conservative - in optimal conditions (no wind, clear day), I've achieved slightly better distances. The gesture controls took me some time to master, but they're remarkably precise once you get the hang of them. It's fascinating to watch how the device interprets different hand movements, responding with subtle adjustments in flight path and speed.

# [**Real-World Usage: Beyond The Basics**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

Most galaxy ball reviews focus on basic functionality, but I wanted to test this device in every possible scenario. Here's what three months of creative experimentation revealed:

For indoor use, you'll want at least a 10x10 foot space, though larger is better when you're learning. What really impressed me was the noise level - at about 45 decibels, it's quieter than most household fans. This means you can use it during video calls or while others are watching TV without causing disruption.

The obstacle avoidance system deserves special mention. Initially, I was skeptical about using it near our ceiling fans, but the built-in sensors consistently detected and avoided them. Even more impressive, after hundreds of indoor flights, we haven't had a single incident of wall marking or furniture damage. The soft exterior material really does its job.

Outdoor performance exceeded my expectations. The Cosmic Globe handles light breezes surprisingly well - anything up to about 8 mph won't significantly affect its flight pattern. Evening use is particularly spectacular; the LED system is visible from up to 100 feet away, creating beautiful light trails during flight. While it can handle light rain (I accidentally tested this), I wouldn't recommend it. The device is water-resistant but not waterproof.

# [**The Learning Journey: A Detailed Progression Guide**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

This is where my experience differs significantly from most galaxy ball reviews. Yes, anyone can get the basic float and catch working within minutes, but mastering this device is a journey that unfolds over weeks. Here's what my family discovered:

During the first week, we focused on fundamentals. Basic launching requires finding the right balance between force and angle - too much power sends it flying erratically, too little and it drops quickly. We spent hours perfecting the basic return motion, which involves a gentle toss at roughly a 30-degree angle. Height control was particularly tricky; it took several days to consistently maintain the ideal hovering height of 3-4 feet.

Weeks two through four saw rapid skill progression. Once we mastered basic flights, figure-eight patterns became our obsession. These require coordinated hand movements and precise timing. Multi-person passing games emerged naturally - we invented several family games, including our favorite ""orbital keep-away,"" where players form a circle and try to maintain continuous flight between them.

By month two, we were attempting advanced maneuvers. The Cosmic Globe can perform complex flight patterns that look like magic to uninitiated observers. We learned to create synchronized movements between two units, coordinate color patterns with flight paths, and even perform what we call ""orbital drops"" - a controlled descent that spirals elegantly to a precise landing point.

# [**Value Analysis: Is It Worth The Investment?**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

After comparing numerous galaxy ball reviews and testing multiple flying orbs, I can confidently discuss the value proposition. The Cosmic Globe isn't cheap, but there's a reason for the premium pricing.

The extended flight duration alone sets it apart - cheaper alternatives typically manage 10-15 minutes at best. The construction quality is evident in every aspect, from the precision-balanced weight distribution to the responsive control system. Regular firmware updates have added new features during my testing period, including enhanced LED patterns and improved stability controls.

Currently, there's a 70% holiday discount that makes this purchase much more accessible. The package includes free express shipping, and you can opt for an extended warranty. For families considering multiple units, bulk purchase savings make it more economical. The money-back guarantee provided peace of mind, though I haven't had any reason to use it.

# [**Long-Term Maintenance: What You Need To Know**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

Few galaxy ball reviews address the maintenance aspect, but it's crucial for longevity. Monthly calibration checks take just a few minutes and ensure optimal performance. The charging port needs occasional cleaning - I use a soft brush every couple of weeks. Firmware updates are easy to install through the companion app, typically adding new features or optimization improvements.

The LED brightness can be adjusted to extend battery life, though I usually keep it at maximum for outdoor use. Sensor alignment rarely needs attention, but there's a simple reset procedure if you notice any flight inconsistencies.

# [**Frequently Asked Questions: Everything You Need To Know**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

After fielding questions from curious neighbors and fellow parents, I've compiled the most comprehensive FAQ section you'll find in any galaxy ball reviews:

**Q: I'm a complete beginner - what's the best way to start learning Cosmic Globe tricks?** 

A: [**The official training video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRH_0fyc_D0) is your perfect starting point. From my experience, mastering the basics takes about a week of consistent practice. The most crucial first step is getting that 30-degree launch angle right - this is the foundation for everything else. I spent three days just practicing this basic return motion until it became muscle memory. Next, you'll want to focus on height control. This might seem simple, but consistent height management is what separates beginners from intermediate users. The video breaks down these fundamentals perfectly, and I recommend watching it several times as you practice each technique.

**Q: How do I progress from basic tricks to advanced maneuvers?** 

A: Once you've mastered the basics, the [**second training video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCobcVf1e3o) is your gateway to advanced techniques. This is where the real fun begins. Start by practicing directional changes during flight - you'll be amazed at how subtle hand movements can completely alter the flight path. After you're comfortable with that, move on to spin modifications. These add that wow factor to even simple movements. The final stage is combining everything into fluid sequences, which typically takes about 2-3 weeks of regular practice to master. This video shows exactly how to progress through each stage safely, and I found myself rewatching certain sections multiple times as I advanced.

**Q: How do you prevent damage during learning?** 

A: Let me be honest - crashes are inevitable, despite what many galaxy ball reviews might suggest. The good news is that the [**Cosmic Globe**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/) is built to handle these learning experiences. From my own crashes (and there were many), I've developed some effective safety practices. Always start in a carpeted area - it provides the perfect balance of protection and practice space. I learned the hard way that maintaining a 3-4 foot minimum height gives you enough reaction time to recover from wobbly flights. Keep your initial catches at waist level; it's tempting to go higher, but waist height offers the best control while you're learning. When you're not practicing, use that protective case - it's not just for show. And if you have pets, make sure they're in another room during practice sessions. My cat once decided to join in, and while hilarious, it wasn't ideal for focused practice.

**Q: What about advanced techniques not covered in basic galaxy ball reviews?**

 A: The training community around this device is incredible and far more extensive than most galaxy ball reviews mention. I've found tremendous value in the weekly live streaming sessions on the official channel - they showcase new tricks and answer questions in real-time. There's also a thriving Facebook community where people share their latest trick discoveries; I've learned some of my best moves there. The Discord community is perfect for getting immediate help when you're stuck on a particular technique. The official mobile app includes detailed training modules that break down complex movements into manageable steps. What really surprised me was discovering local meetup groups - there's nothing quite like learning in person from experienced users.

**Q: How do you optimize battery performance?** 

A: Through months of testing, I've discovered several key practices that significantly extend battery life. The most crucial step happens right out of the box - always do a full charge before first use. This helps condition the battery properly. Every 15-20 cycles, I recommend letting the device completely discharge before recharging; this helps maintain optimal battery capacity. While any USB-C cable will work, I've noticed better charging performance with the official cable. Temperature management makes a big difference too - store your Cosmic Globe at room temperature, avoiding hot cars or cold garages. The regular firmware updates often include power optimization improvements, so don't skip these. Following these practices, my unit still maintains its original battery performance after three months of heavy use.

**Q: What about indoor practice spaces?** 

A: While most galaxy ball reviews suggest a 10x10 foot minimum, my experience shows space requirements vary significantly based on skill level. Beginners should aim for about 12x12 feet - this gives you enough room to make mistakes without constantly hitting walls. As you advance to intermediate tricks, you'll want closer to 15x15 feet to properly execute figure-eights and basic combinations. Advanced maneuvers really need about 20x20 feet for full expression. Ceiling height is crucial too - aim for at least 8 feet to avoid any unfortunate ceiling fan encounters. The most important aspect isn't just the space size, but making sure it's clear of obstacles. I rearranged my basement specifically for practice sessions, creating a dedicated flight zone that's made a huge difference in my progression.

**Q: How do you troubleshoot common issues?** 

A: After three months of daily use, I've encountered and resolved most common problems. If you notice erratic flight patterns, a quick sensor calibration usually sorts things out - it's a simple process that takes about 30 seconds. Weak returns often indicate either a low battery or incorrect launch angle; I always check both when this happens. LED flickering typically means you need a firmware update, which is easily done through the app. When range seems reduced, first clean the sensors with a soft cloth, then check for any potential interference sources like WiFi routers or Bluetooth devices. For slow response times, a full reset and clearing the device pairing usually resolves the issue. These problems are rare, but knowing how to fix them quickly keeps the fun going without frustration.

**Q: What accessories are worth buying?** 

A: From my experience, not everything marketed for the Cosmic Globe is worth your money, but certain accessories genuinely enhance the experience. The protective carrying case is absolutely essential - I learned this after almost damaging my unit during transport. Having extra charging cables has saved me numerous times, especially during family gatherings where multiple people want to try it. The LED filter set might seem gimmicky, but it's fantastic for creating stunning photos and videos, especially during evening practice sessions. Training target rings have seriously improved my accuracy - they provide clear goals for practicing precision flights. A display stand might seem unnecessary, but it's actually quite practical; it keeps your device safe when charging and looks pretty cool on a shelf. I'd skip most of the other accessories being marketed; these are the ones that have proven their worth through regular use.

"I wanted to share something that’s made a huge difference for me when playing Fortnite. I usually play with friends who are in other countries, and honestly, lag was always a big problem for me.

So, I decided to try out NoPing. I wasn’t sure if it would really help, but I gave their 7-day free trial a shot. And the results impressed me, My ping dropped from 237 to around 151-156. It felt like I’d upgraded my internet. Now I can play with my friends who are not in my country.

[my internet](https://preview.redd.it/hsmxjzhnmn4e1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=399d9c3a2be6337c5f7afbed78de3bd30ede1494)

It automatically picks the best route, so I didn’t have to mess with technical stuff, it was easy to configure.

After the free trial, I ended up subscribing because it made a good difference. I use it not just for Fortnite but for other games too. And if it’s not for you, you can cancel before the trial ends. I saw some people complaining, but the website clearly explains that you need to cancel before the trial ends to avoid your subscription being renewed. It’s like any other software on the internet that offers a trial plan—it’s pretty common.

If you’re dealing with high ping, especially when playing with friends from other countries like me, you can give it a shot."

"I just picked one of these up from walmart, I got a non-medicated one.

Honestly it does open up my nose but it also makes it feel very dry. I don’t like it much better but at least I can breathe.

Considering trying boom boom, maybe the essential oils in them will help them work better. Has anyone tried them?"
"Hey everyone,

This is a little review about me using NoPing and how I fixed my Dota 2 Ping problems using it. If you’re having lag like me, then this may come in handy.



Without NoPing:

https://preview.redd.it/gids682abl3e1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=6666f1cfe9eee9fa8ab5242265bcd5c4f16579c9

With NoPing:

https://preview.redd.it/evulewxabl3e1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb4f6081cf30606ce5106804e9eca30962b2a8d7

Ping: Went from 203 to 141, thats indeed helped me a lot.

About the Subscription and Trial:

I used the 7 day free trial before I bought anything, and it worked like a charm. This trial was easy to end on my account page , I did it anyways just in case there were any issues. But I  signed up for the monthly plan immediately afterwards. 100% worth it for how good it made my game play.



Experience: Everything feels smooth now. Commands come with no lag and I can actually not worry about lag.

I ran multiple routes with NoPing and it picked the most stable for my area on autopilot. It was super simple to setup — Even works with a bunch of other games so it is multipurpose if you play more than Dota 2.

For me, on my review it was worth every penny. You can give it a shot if you have high ping I’d say."

# 1. [Cosmic Globe (9.8/10) - The Clear Winner](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

* Battery Life: This thing is INSANE. 15-min charge gives you 45 min of flight. Other balls barely hit 15 minutes.
* Build Quality: Super tough but soft material. My 6-year-old crashed it countless times - not a scratch.
* Control: The ""Whirl Technology"" isn't just marketing talk. It actually returns to your hand like a boomerang.

1. Actually Works Indoors: Unlike others that smash into everything, this one has legit collision avoidance.
2. Battery Life is No Joke: We had family game nights where it lasted the whole time. Other balls needed 3-4 recharges.
3. Worth the Money: Yes, you can get cheaper ones. But you'll end up buying 2-3 when they break or die. This one just keeps going.

# [Tips We Learned](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

* Start with basic tosses to get the hang of it
* 30-degree launch angle works best
* Practice the shake-to-stop feature early (saves a lot of crashes)

https://preview.redd.it/7iw7iypj1q3e1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13774688104ef45008d02c9c90f61374fb34e4e8

# [Bottom Line](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

If you want a flying spinner ball that actually works and lasts, grab the Cosmic Globe while it's 70% off. The battery life alone makes it worth it, but the durability and control are what really set it apart from every other boomerang ball we tested.

[**Pro Tip: Order from their official site. We saw some sketchy knockoffs on other marketplaces.**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

Edit: Added some clarification on battery life testing Edit 2: Holy cow, this blew up! RIP inbox 😅 Edit 3: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

# [Flying Orb Ball FAQs: Everything You Need to Know Before Buying (2024)](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

Hey there! After getting tons of questions about flying orb balls (especially the Cosmic Globe), I figured I'd put together a complete FAQ. Hope this helps!

# 🤔 Basic Questions

# What exactly is a flying orb/spinner ball?

It's a palm-sized gadget that hovers, spins, and can perform aerial tricks using motion sensors and built-in propulsion. Think of it like a boomerang that you can control with your hands.

# Are these actually fun or just another gimmick?

Honestly depends on which one you get. The cheap ones? Total gimmick - they die in 10 minutes and crash constantly. But quality ones like the Cosmic Globe? Legitimately addictive. My kids AND their grandparents fight over who gets to play with it next.

# How hard are they to control?

* Cheap ones: Like trying to catch a hyperactive butterfly
* Cosmic Globe: Super intuitive - my 6-year-old mastered it in about 5 minutes

# 💭 Common Concerns

# Are they safe for indoor use?

Again, depends on the model:

* Knock-offs: Definitely not (RIP my living room lamp)
* Cosmic Globe: Actually designed for indoor use with collision avoidance tech and soft materials

# What about battery life?

Here's the brutal truth about flight times:

* Most flying orbs: 8-10 minutes
* Cosmic Globe: 45 minutes (yes, really)
* Charging time varies from 15 minutes (Cosmic Globe) to 25+ minutes (others)

# Do they break easily?

* Budget models: One bad crash and it's game over
* Cosmic Globe: My nephew has crashed it approximately 47,283 times (rough estimate) - still works perfectly

# 🏆 Why Cosmic Globe Dominates

# What makes it worth the extra money?

1. Battery life is 4-5x longer than competitors
2. Actually returns to your hand instead of flying randomly
3. Won't break if your kid crashes it
4. Safe for indoor use (won't destroy your house)
5. Currently 70% off which makes it cheaper than replacing multiple budget ones

# Is the ""Whirl Technology"" actually different?

Yes! It's not just marketing fluff:

* Regular orbs use basic propulsion
* Cosmic Globe's tech ensures stable flight paths and predictable returns
* You can actually control where it goes instead of just hoping for the best

# 🎯 Pro Tips

# Best Ways to Use Your Flying Orb:

1. Start with basic tosses at 30-degree angles
2. Practice the shake-to-stop feature first
3. Try simple tricks before advancing to complex moves
4. Use LED effects for awesome night-time displays

# Red Flags When Buying:

* Super cheap prices (usually knockoffs)
* No mention of battery life
* Vague descriptions of materials
* Missing safety features

# 🤓 Technical Stuff

# Battery Specs Comparison:

* Cosmic Globe: 45 min flight / 15 min charge
* Average competitors: 8-10 min flight / 25+ min charge

# Range Capabilities:

* Cosmic Globe: Up to 45 meters
* Typical orbs: 15-20 meters

# 💡 Final Words

[**If you're considering a flying orb ball, here's the bottom line: While the Cosmic Globe costs more upfront, it's actually cheaper in the long run because:**](https://www.verifiedreviewpro.com/best-galaxy-balls/)

* You won't need to replace it
* The battery lasts way longer

Odds of winning depend on the total number of entries.

**Brief Overview of the Mice**

The ROG Harpe Ace Extreme, ROG Keris II Ace, and ROG Harpe Ace Mini may differ in size and shape but are all designed with the feedback of pro gamers with respect to size, shape, weight, and features needed to compete at the highest levels. If you choose any of these mice, you'll get the following: 

* Ultra-lightweight mouse design from 47g (ROG Harpe Ace Extreme) to 54g (ROG Keris II Ace) without using holes or omitting RGB lighting
* ROG AimPoint Pro Optical Sensor with 100-42,000 DPI with <1% Deviation, track-on-glass capability, 750 IPS, and 50g max acceleration
* ROG Optical Micro Switches provide a clicky and instant actuation with 100-million-click lifespan and a QC process that ensures left and right mouse switches are within a 5 gram-force deviation range for click consistency
* Up to a true 8K Wireless Polling rate with ROG Polling Rate Booster\*
* ROG Omni Receiver - Use an Omni-compatible ROG keyboard and mouse on the same dongle

\*\*The ROG Harpe Ace Extreme is controlled and updated through Armoury Crate Gear.

**Mouse Shapes -**

One of the most critical choices when choosing a gaming mouse is the shape. Shape affects comfort, grip, grip styles, and your ability to use the mouse as an extension of your hand. Each of these mice has a distinctive shape and design to accommodate different play styles and also features anti-slip mouse tape to help you achieve a perfect grip for extended gaming sessions.

Using the [EloShapes comparison tool](https://www.eloshapes.com/mouse/compare?p=asus-rog-harpe-ace-extreme-vs.-asus-rog-keris-ii-ace-vs.-asus-rog-harpe-ace-mini), here's a look at how the mice stack up:

https://preview.redd.it/pruv7hos399e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7e8693fc9867082d7c53a3bbf2be88746207a5a

Starting with the ROG Harpe Ace Extreme, the semi-symmetrical mouse features a slightly different location for the hump compared to the original ROG Harpe Ace Aimlab Edition. However, the carbon fiber composite provides a firm shell that can absorb force while retaining a 47-gram weight.

The ROG Keris II Ace is designed with an ergonomic shape to deliver maximum comfort and better control. The sides are sloped inwards to provide a solid, effortless grip, while the extended side ledge gives you extra room to rest your ring finger. The side buttons are positioned for better thumb accessibility.

The ROG Harpe Ace Mini is also a semi-symmetrical mouse in the profile of the standard Harpe Ace, but is shorter in length with a shallower hump, which can be more beneficial for fingertip grips.

# The ROG Gaming Mice Essentials

**ROG Harpe Ace Extreme**

https://preview.redd.it/r5uqdxx1499e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=52b0141a03e4777bc9f776972500a81cd2707740

The ROG Harpe Ace Extreme is a stunner. At only 47g, the mouse is extremely light and remarkably strong due to its carbon fiber shell. The left and right buttons are cut out from separate pieces of carbon fiber and skillfully matched to ensure the weave patterns on the shell match up at the most aesthetically pleasing angles, meaning that each Harpe Ace Extreme is unique to its owner.

Other features:

* A TTC Gold scroll wheel encoder provides pronounced tactility and stops with up to 1 million cycles.
* Corning Gorilla Glass Mouse Feet are included for cloth mouse pad users looking for smoother and more effortless movements.

Product Page: [https://rog.asus.com/us/mice-mouse-pads/mice/ambidextrous/rog-harpe-ace-extreme/](https://rog.asus.com/us/mice-mouse-pads/mice/ambidextrous/rog-harpe-ace-extreme/)

The ROG Keris II Ace is an ergonomic gaming mouse that provides a comfortable grip whether you're hours into a gaming session or need precise control to finish a project. With a bio-based nylon shell design that keeps it at a still ultra-lightweight 54g, the Keris II Ace requires little effort to move the mouse into position or flick it across your mousepad.

* Available in black and moonlight white

The ROG Harpe Ace Mini fits everything you'd want in a mini-size pro gaming mouse without sacrificing performance or adding extra weight.

"Hello all my mouse lovers and enthusiasts. Today is a very special day. I have been so excited to finally use the Endgame Gear Op1 8k Purple Frost edition and after a good days worth of gaming here is my review.

TL;DR: This is hands down the best mouse on the market. Look past the wire and you literally have yourself a mouse worthy being called an ""ENDGAME"" mouse. The switches are soft yet crispy. The coating is smooth, but not slippery. The shape is the most ""locked in"" shape out there. Has the new PAW3950 sensor. The 8k polling feels night and day compared to any other mouse on the market. You get all this for only $90. Also easy to use and understand software which allows you to lower the click latency. 51g btw.

FULL REVIEW:

SHAPE - The shape is truly what shocked me. As we all know, at the end of the day a mouse can have all these bells and whistles but if the shape is uncomfortable then it's not for you. This shape is for me. My hand is 19cm×10cm. My grip style is a hybrid between palm and a relaxed claw. The ""locked in"" feel I get from holding this mouse is right there with the Razer Viper V3 Pro. 

COATING - The coating is the best I've ever felt. It's nice and smooth but not slippery. I never find my skin slipping off the mouse at all. I will mention I do have naturally clammy hands so if you have dry hands maybe your experience will differ.

WEIGHT - Not much to say here. It's only 51g. I use a bungee for the wire and it basically feels wireless. I will say I have a high sens so I rarely ever swing my mouse side to side on my mousepad.

SENSOR - Before I started using this Op1 8k Purple Frost, I thought the Logitech G PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 and the Razer Viper V3 Pro had the best sensors on the mouse market. I was wrong. The PAW3950 sensor on this mous feels so much better on my 360hz monitor. It gets even better as I use higher polling rates. The 8k polling rate is so f*cking smooth. Now in all honesty, I won't be using it at 8k unless I'm playing VALORANT. I'll be using it at 2k polling rate. I just never knew the difference between a top tier wireless sensor compared to a top tier wired sensor could be so night and day.

SCROLL WHEEL - It does the job. It's a little small for my liking but it still works fine. The only time I'm ever using my scroll wheel is when I'm playing Fortnite picking up items so it doesn't really matter to me.

SIDE BUTTONS - Wow these side buttons are crisp. No post or pre-travel whatsoever. This to me is very important because I use my side buttons to edit and reset edits on Fortnite. So I need to be able to really FEEL that click on a moments notice.

PRICE - It's $90 on Amazon. Honestly with this being the best mouse on the market (especially spec wise) this is a STEAL. I paid $200 for my Japanese imported Razer Viper V3 Pro Gengar Edition, $160 for my Logitech G pro x superlight 2, and $140 on my Fnatic Maya X 8k. All of those mice are NOTHING compared to the Endgame Gear Op1 8k Purple Frost edition.

SOFTWARE - You can find the software download on Endgame Gear's website. *NOTE: the Purple Frost edition has a complete different download than the regular Op1 8k. Probably because of the updated sensor.*

BATTERY LIFE - It's wired. So basically infinite as long as you don't have anything sharp next to your wire.

CONCLUSION - I love this mouse. The only other wired mouse I've been using here and there was the Razer Deathadder V3 and I only used to to play casual games and edit videos. This one will be different. The Endgame Gear Op1 8k Purple Frost edition WILL be my main for the foreseeable future. Yes I will still have my mouse rotation, but when it comes to playing ranked VALORANT or ranked Fortnite I will be using this mouse. I understand if you're someone who won't switch to wired. I get it. I was scared as well. But I'm so happy I opened up my options to wired as well still using wireless mice. I want to also say I own or have used most of the best mice on the market. So me saying this is THE BEST mouse I've ever used really holds a lot of weight. At least to me it does. 

If you've read all the way till the end, thank you. I really wanted to show my love for this mouse to all of you. I don't have any friends who are mouse enthusiast like me so this Reddit being here is awesome. I get to express my love for mice to everyone.

If you have any other questions about the mouse, let me know in the comments. Have a great day."
"Hi guys! I got my V3 PRO yesterday on physical store (Spain) and I gave it some testing hours on Counter Strike 2 already. So, here are my thoughts:

**For context:**

I am a gaming enthusiast, who loves everything tech related and enjoys playing CS2 many hours a day on competitive modes. I have a 20.5x11cm hand and palm grip. I use 1600DPI on synapse x 0,56 in game (890 edpi). My mat is a Razer Strider XXL. I definitely love Razer products by Im not a fanboy. If I have to roast them because they did a bad product or any other brand makes a better product I have no problem to admit it.

I own the V2 Pro, Deathadder V3 Pro and previously owned Logitech GPX Superlight 1 and 2.

My native language is Spanish, so I will apologize now for any grammar mistake. Feel free to correct me or ask me I don't manage to make myself clear ;).

What I can say so far its that the new Viper is a improved version of the GPX 1/2 series. It doesn’t feel like any Razer mouse I’ve owned previously and it improves every aspect that I didn’t like about the GPX’s.

**Build Quality:**

The V3 Pro feels pretty sturdy. I couldn't feel any kind of flex on its structure when I intentionally pressed it with reasonable force. Build quality feels more solid than DAV3 PRO and previous iteration of this mouse. My unit is also free of play around scroll wheel or switches, definitely 10 out of 10.

**Coating:**

I might be the only guy in the world who loved Viper V2 Pro coating. It reminds me a bit of a very subtle sand paper, definitely on the rough side. My DAV3 PRO unit was a bit smoother but still had some texture on it. The coating on the V3 is nothing like it. Its definitely smooth and feels like you are touching a GPX coating. Personally I don't like it, but I had no gripping issues even when my hands where sweaty after some hours playing on a 22 celsius room.

**Shape:**

I’ve never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knucles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO specially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse. I love that ""butt"" part of my Viper V2 PRO and It was one of the main reasons that made me main that mouse for 1 year. I was a bit afraid when I saw they made it narrower but I can say that mouse feels perfect locked between your thumb and side fingers.

**Weight:**

Its 5 grams lighter than the V2 PRO, I can feel no difference at all in terms of weight since its so small. I can feel the difference between the V3 PRO and the DAV3 PRO but its just a bit more drag.

**Switches:**

It feels like you are clicking a GPX Superlight series mouse, it doesn't feel like any Razer product I previously owned. They do sound more like GPX and clicks like something between GPX 1 and 2. The force you need to apply is something between a GPX 1 and 2 and the tactile feedback feels pretty much like those guys. Im sad because I loved the force, click and sound of the Viper V2 PRO :(. The signature roof tiled shape of the Viper switches doesn't feel the same. It's doesn't go as deep on the switch as it use to. If you don't click on the front part of the switch, you'll barely feel it. Anyways, they are nice, good quality and they work perfect.

**Scroll Wheel and Side Buttons:**

Scroll wheel feels solid and sturdy with no play, it is pretty much the same like V2 PRO's wheel. You will get your feedback with every dent increment you move and feels very precise. I can't feel any pre or post travel. I hated the wheel of the GPX's and I definitely didn't like its coating.

If you previously owned a V2 PRO you will notice the side buttons are in a different place now, but you'll get used to it in 30 seconds. They are bigger and they don't feel mushy at all. They are clicky and solid and can't feel any play when I use them, which is all the time for voice comms in CS2.

**Skates:**

I hated the skates of the GPX's series, so I was a bit afraid when I saw that Razer decided to copy them. They felt very slow to me. Im not a physics guy but I tend to think that not necessarily more PTFE will slide better since I think sometimes more sliding surface means more friction. I don't know, but GPX's definitely felt slower than Razer's skates which I think they glide really nice and I never felt the necessity to change them for a third party brand. I can say that this new skates on the V3 PRO slide smooth and are great. My first impression was that they were just a tiny tad slower than the V2 but felt that I have a bit more control. After some hours gaming on them they started to feel a bit faster and the control and stopping was still there. I had some great flickshots with a very tiny window to react and I can't complain. I need to use it for some days, but I have the hunch that this is a good change and ultimately these skates are better than the ones on the DAV3 PRO and the V2. Like I said, I was afraid of the shape of the new skates, but im very tranquilo now ;).

**8000hz Polling rate:**

If you are buying this mouse because you want to feel what its like to play on a 8000hz polling rate device, dont do it. I can't tell the difference and I feel nothing from going to 1000/2000hz to 8000hz. I'm being completely honest. I mean, sure there is a difference, but one is going to have 0 impact on your aim... I have 1200h on Counter Strike and I play nearly 30 hours a week, so, trust me ;).

EDIT: I thought many times about writing that I currently own a 170hz monitor and I play around 300fps and I know people states that they can tell the difference with 240hz/360hz monitors up to 4000hz polling rate. They also state that they can't tell the difference between 4000hz and 8000hz so take into account that this is my experience with my current hardware. I'm planning to get a 240hz monitor soon, I will update this review when I get the new monitor and see If Im able to feel something different then!

**Value:**

I paid 179€ for this mouse which has pretty much the best features out there on the market (except weight), but they are not impactful at all. I get that if you go measure all that stuff with right instruments this mouse is going to give you better results. But you will not be able to feel any of those benefits on your daily gaming sessions, so maybe you can go for a cheaper model with half the polling rate or without the last sensor on the market, since you will be still as bad/good, slow/fast, precise/sloppy as you where with your old V2 PRO. I don't think it has a great value. It would be great if i was 20€ cheaper.

**Final thoughts:**

I have nothing to say about the sensor. I mean maybe its better and has lower latency than other sensors out there, but you won't be able to tell the difference. Many mice on the market share same sensor brand/model and they are pretty much good unless they are malfunctioning for some reason.

I think the new Razer Viper V3 PRO doesn't feel like a Razer product, its more like an improved version of the GPX Series (but we already knew that). I cant feel the soul or the Identity of Razer brand nor the character of my beloved Viper series. If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought It was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed. Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs.

Thanks for reading!

UPDATE: @Ninjutso_Bill has responded below. 

“Not sure what happened I’ll need to further look into this when we get to work but we did not intentionally remove any reviews. We’re on national labor holiday actually and we don’t work. Most likely this is an issue with the app we are using under Shopify. We don’t have any reasons to delete these as most of the reviews, above 90%, are 5 stars and most of the negative reviews are on the late shipping which is indeed our fault due to the production not being able to keep up with the demand. Regarding the clicking issue it only involves like 10-20 cases maximum within a batch of 1500 units in to all we shipped out so it’s very minor. Al those units can be either replaced with free shipping without no need for return or full refund when we get to work.

We’ll never forget how the community has been supporting us so far. Hope this can clear things up. Thank you.”


Support will return on Monday May 6 Beijing Time according to Bill"
"I got my first wireless mouse after using a deathadder essential for couple years and cobra for last couple months.
After using this for a month i can confidently say this is the default wireless mouse. Its not really superlight or too heavy. It has a potato shape. It has great battery life. If you dont know what got get just buy this. Its like the white airforce 1 of the mouse community. You cant go wrong with it if you dont have an extreme condition."

[HITSCAN Hyperlight 8K - Black](https://preview.redd.it/5sd7v35r7zwd1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db782cea652e96a537b2caae976fc81abee4fc5e)

# UNBOXING

To start off, most here should have heard by now that ATK stole the first design iteration of the Hyperlight shape and quickly released it to market before they did. However, HITSCAN have since refined the shape and internal structure for the full release, offering a more premium product and build as a result. The packaging has a sleek, minimalistic design with a top down render of the mouse on the front, and the logo and product name on the sides. I personally love the branding and design. Both the standard and 8k dongle look alike with an octagonal puck design, but the logo on the standard is blacked out, while the 8k lights up (and can be turned off if desired). The mouse comes without any skates applied, so you have the option of choosing from the large or small set provided in the box.

**Specs:** 

* **Dimensions:** 118x61x38mm
* **Weight:** 39g(±1g)
* **Main switches:** Omron optical
* **Side switches:** TTC mechanical
* **Encoder:** TTC gold

[Weight \(42g on my scale - w\/ large skates applied\)](https://preview.redd.it/psgv1bwn7zwd1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1178e042a8bffe8537aff672a8433140841bac98)



# BUTTONS

**Main Clicks** 

The main clicks use omron optical switches. As with most omron optical clicks, these have a break-in period where they're tighter/a little heavier out of the box, but soften with use. These have a similar satisfying implementation to the sora v2's clicks, but with extremely minimal sideplay in comparison. Pre-travel is minimal, and post-travel is the right amount to give it a nice bounce. They require a light-medium amount of force to press and the actuation has a nice crunch. Clicking from the front of the buttons will exhibit a bit extra pre- and post-travel.

**Scrollwheel & Side Buttons**

The scrollwheel uses a TTC gold encoder. The tactility between steps feels great, though there are times where there's this loose grinding sound occurring while fast scrolling. To clarify, this is only audible though and not at all something that affects the scrolling experience. The middle click is light-medium and has a good bounce.

The side buttons use TTC mechanical switches. They're well placed and easy to reach. The tactility is decent. Pre-travel is low and post-travel is a good enough amount – with the back side button exhibiting a little more post-travel, but the decently quick rebound makes it not too slow to spam.

# COATING, CABLE, SKATES, & WEIGHT

The hyperlight has a rubbery matte coating that grips quite well with my dry hands. It's the type that works well with sweaty hands too, but you will likely see sweat marks on the black version that go away when given a wipe down. I'd say it compares most to the sora v2, but a little more damp and warm-feeling with use. The cable that comes with the mouse is stiff, but this has become the standard for 8k mice now as it ensures less instability and interference. As mentioned, the mouse comes without any skates applied, and there's a set of large and small skates included in the box, which you can select from and even mix & match if you prefer. I went with the larger skates. These are great, and you most likely won't be needing aftermarket skates. Their speed is kinda inbetween jades and corepads, though not as smooth as either. Do note, they have a break-in period and feel a bit controlled out of the box.

The weight comes in at 42g on my scale with the large skates applied. It feels a little denser at the front, but the weight is centered towards the middle. It's light enough weight to where it didn't bother me in use and went unnoticed majority of the time. The build quality is outstanding. I haven't experienced any button sideplay, shell creak, or internal rattle going on. It feels sturdier than the sora v2 and scyrox v8 for reference, which should tell you a lot since those are already very well built.

# SHAPE

My hands are 19.5x10cm and I use a [relaxed pincer claw grip](https://i.imgur.com/sin7VRe.png). Before describing the shape, here's how I grip the HITSCAN Hyperlight:

[contact points & grip style](https://imgur.com/a/ocaJyto)

I find the Hyperlight shape to be very safe and should work well with relax claw for different hand sizes. The buttons feature comfort grooves that are mildly deep, which somewhat influence my fingers into a centered position and feels quite nice. The sides have hardly any front and back flare, and the curves are subtle enough to not feel completely flat. My favorite part about the sides is how well rounded the top edges are where the clicks cut off. This allows my ring finger to very comfortably wrap around it, and makes the contact feel ""fluid""/whole. It also makes it feel natural to roll my ring finger around that contact point as my hands/grip flex and shift while tensing in use. Another thing I enjoy about the sides is how it rounds out towards the very front of the mouse and allows the tip of my ring finger to comfortably latch on. As for the hump, it is at a middling height of 38mm, has a rounded feel at the top with a slight edge towards the sides, and feels relatively wide since it retains its slope while extending towards the very back of the mouse instead of quickly tapering and narrowing in – like the sora v2 for example. Despite its width, however, my palm doesn't feel restricted and I can freely tilt/position my grip how I want due to its nicely rounded shape, lack of a noticeable rear flare, and not too tall height. For me, it's not the most exciting-feeling shape out there when compared to thinner mice, or ones with tapered sides, but it's one that's so well designed and safe that I enjoy it simply because of the comfort, and my performance on it.

As for comparisons, I don't own the ATK F1 myself, but one of the key changes HITSCAN told me they made to refine the shape from their first design was reduce the width of the rear. The reasoning behind this is for ""enhanced maneuverability from wrist rotations,"" which I do agree with. The Hyperlight appears to also have straighter sides, and its sensor position is slightly higher. I've also seen this being called a viper mini alternative, which I guess I can see some inspiration from with its hump position and front side curvature, but this feels closer to medium size in general due to its wider hump width, much more gradual hump slope towards the sides, and flatter sides/wider grip width. Of the mice I own, this is probably closest to the lamzu maya, but with a safer, more condensed shape. The back of the maya is slightly lower and flatter, the sides are more tapered, and the button height feels a little taller due to having minor grooves. The maya is a top performing shape for me, but I think the hyperlight takes its spot for my personal top 3 shapes due to being more comfortable, lighter, and also more precise-feeling with its button height and compact, pronounced hump.

# SOFTWARE, 8K DONGLE, & BATTERY LIFE

The software is very simple to go through, and I've provided screenshots of it in the link below. The 8k dongle is sold separately from the mouse, and the instructions to pair it will be provided in a tiny pamphlet. Keep in mind, the standard dongle that comes with the mouse will look identical, aside from having the logo blacked out. It's easy to distinguish from the 8k dongle since the 8k dongle logo lights up, which you can also disable by holding a combination of buttons on the mouse. The led on the mouse, and the 8k dongle (if you enable it), will pulse red at 15%. It pulses orange while charging, and stays blue once fully charged. It lasted me around 3-4 days of moderate use at 4khz.

# CLOSING THOUGHTS

The HITSCAN Hyperlight has been the release I've been anticipating the most this year after having seen their announcement here on reddit. The shape looked extremely good, and the specs all sounded up to par with other premium offerings in the market. It's safe to say that they have met –and even surpassed– my expectations with its outstanding build quality, coating, skates, and click-feel. I'm glad that despite having their first design stolen, they took the time needed to refine and deliver an exceptional product. I'm not going to deny that the atk f1 isn't great value for the price, and it's not expected for consumers to care about the morals behind companies, but if you believe in owning mice that ""feel"" close to endgame, the Hyperlight will definitely line up more with those expectations with its flawless execution. This is a top 3 shape for me personally – along with the atlantis mini and sora v2.

Buying a claw grip lightweight mouse and giving 1 star cause It's not an ergo full of RGB... What do yall think?
"[https://www.rtings.com/mouse/reviews/logitech/g-pro-x-superlight-2](https://www.rtings.com/mouse/reviews/logitech/g-pro-x-superlight-2)

1. Update: We retested this mouse after the newest firmware update increased the maximum wireless polling rate to 8000Hz. The update significantly improved the CPI, Click Latency, and Sensor Latency.

Biggest changes from what I see: SRAV is fixed, sensor latency is superb and is beating every single mouse out on the market rn (4000hz latency is ABSOLUTELY insane)"
"Hello my mouse lovers and enthusiasts!

Oh boy, today's review is going to be a good one. Today I'm going to be reviewing the new Waizowl OGM Cloud V2 and without trying to spoil much I just have to say this mouse has suprised me in every way possible. Of course,  before I start, I just want to remind everyone that I purchased this mouse with my own hard earned cash. So everything I say are my thoughts only. Let's go!

TL;DR: The Waizowl OGM Cloud V2 weighs in at only 55g despite its large design. The main switches and side switches feel crispy with little to no pre-travel or post-travel. The coating is just like Zowie's where it feels premium, but it is a fingerprint magnet. The shape of the mouse is different, but i like it. The hump is lower than the Viper V3 Pro's but wider than the Endgame Gear Op1w. This mouse feels great to claw grip. The factory skates are okay, but I threw on a extra pair of X-Raypad Viper V2 Pro OBSIDIAN that I had lying around. The mouse also comes with a 8k dongle which is a huge 'W' from Waizowl. My biggest complaint is the scroll wheel due to it being kinda loud and like I said before the coating is a fingerprint magnet.

FULL REVIEW:

WEIGHT - The Waizowl OGM Cloud V2 comes in at 55g without skates on. I was very suprised considering how big the mouse is. The weight is balanced very well.

MAIN SWITCHES - The left and right clicks feel spectacular. Some of the best I have ever used. They're using Huano Transparent Blue Shell Pink Dots. There is basically no pre-travel or post-travel. When in-game it feels like I barely have to use any finger strength to click and spam clicking feels great as well. Also no side wobble.

SENSOR - The Waizowl OGM Cloud V2 is using a PAW3950 sensor. The only advantage of having this sensor is that you can set your Lift Off Distance (LOD) to 0.7mm, which to be honest I can barely even notice compared to having it at 1mm LOD.

COATING - The mouse is using Waizowl's new GEN 3 ""Feather"" coating. Look idk what that means so I'll just say this. If you've used a Zowie mouse before, then you'll know how the coating feels. The coating is also a fingerprint magnet just like Zowie mice.

SHAPE - The shape is basically a scaled up version of Endgame Gear's Op1w 4k except the hump peaks around more in the middle where the Op1w 4k hump peaks in the back end. For me personally, I like the shape. It took a little getting used to, but now I would say this is in my top 5 favorite mice to claw grip. You can also palm grip this mouse without having any hang off.

SIDE BUTTONS - Due to how low profile the mouse is, the side buttons are always next to my thumb which I like considering when I play Fortnite, I edit and reset edits with my side buttons. I will mention, sometimes it feels like i have to reach for the front side button but most of the time I don't. The side buttons also feel crispy with little to no pre-travel or post-travel and no wiggling.

SCROLL WHEEL - The scroll wheel also kinda feels like a Zowie scroll wheel. It's also pretty loud compared to something like the Viper V3 Pro or Hitscan Hyperlight. It doesn't bother me that much when I'm playing in game. But when I'm just scrolling on social media it can be a little obnoxious.

POLLING RATE - Out of the box you get Waizowl's 8k dongle. No need to pay extra. I like that. I wish that was the norm, but it's not. Heck, even if this mouse came with Waizowl's 4k dongle I'd be happy. I'm someone who likes to play on 2k polling rate. The 8k dongle itself looks pretty cool with a little bit of RGB.

COLOR - Black. Which is pretty sad considering Waizowl's other mouse, the OGM Pro V2, has so many other different options when it comes to colors and designs.

BATTERY LIFE - After using the mouse for about 4 days of heavy usage I had to plug it in to charge it. It has a Type-C port which is the norm nowadays. I'll say it only look about an hour until it reached full charge however that's probably due to the fact that I charge my mice from a separate charger and not from my PC.

SKATES - The mouse comes with no skates on. You get full sized fitted skates that you can use or dots. I just found an extra paid of X-Raypad Viper V2 Pro OBSIDIAN skates I had lying around and used those instead. I'm sure the factory skates are fine considering they're 100% PTFE like most other factory skates.

SOFTWARE - Easy to use software. You can find it on Waizowl's website. It allows you to do everything you need to do which I like. I like it when mice software are simple and doesn't need access to my whole computer (looking at you ROG software).

PRICE - The mouse comes in at just $95. I bought mine off of Lethal Gaming Gear's website and right now as of writing this review they're all sold out.

CONCLUSION - This is a great mouse. The only reason why I even bought this mouse to begin with was because I was intrigued with it's shape. Apparently not many people know about this mouse or the Waizowl brand period. I can't say much about the brand or their other mice, but I can say that this mouse is pretty damn good. I guess the only thing I could wish for is if there were different colors. Right now all they have is Black for the Waizowl OGM Cloud V2. I took a closer look at their website and their OGM Pro V2 mice have WAY more different options to choose from when it comes to colors and designs.

If you have any other questions about the Waizowl OGM Cloud V2, let me know in the comments.

Thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day."

***(This is my first true attempt at a review so please play nice.)***

This is my review of the X3 from Attack Shark. I came across this mouse shopping on Amazon by searching ""3395 Gaming Mouse"". I took a chance and I paid it for $39.17 and received it the same day.

**Specs**

Sensor: PAW3395

Size: 118.5\*61\*39.7 mm

Weight: 49±3grams (my copy weighted in at 54g on my scale)

Polling Rate: 125Hz-1000Hz.

Main Click Switches: Kailh Black Mamba Micro-Motion Switches, 80 Million Click

Scroll Wheel:  TTC ENCODER

Connectivity: 2.4Ghz Wireless/Bluetooth/USB-C Wired

Battery Life According to the item description: Up to 200Hrs

**Build Quality:** My first impression of the X3 was, for a peripheral that cost less than a sushi dinner for one, this thing is built fairly well. If I squeeze the heck out of it, there is no creaking or popping. When I shake it, there is a very slight rattle of the scroll wheel, but nothing that you would feel in game. The bottom of the mouse doesn't flex when I push on it. The clicks feel nice and snappy. They are a little heavier than I would like, but that is my personal preference. There really isn't much pre/post travel on M1 or M2. I enjoy the scroll wheel quite a bit, it has some really nice defined steps and isn't too loud or scratchy. Mouse 3 and 4 feel nice with some post travel. The weight balance seems to be okay, If anything I would say it is potentially a bit back heavy. That may be due to battery placement inside the shell.

**Performance:** I had no issues with sensor tracking and did not experience any spin out. The polling rate seemed to be stable, and I did not feel any stutter or jitteriness. My main shooters are CS:GO and Halo Infinite. I felt I performed well, and the shape really grew on me. The shape seems to pretty much be the Ajazz Aj199 and doing a little searching around Amazon, Attack Shark might even be a sub-brand of Ajazz(?) I don't know that exactly, I could be wrong. I also used the mouse to play Dota 2 and the X3 will now be my main mouse for that particular game moving forward. I use a relaxed claw style grip and have baby hands (17cm x 10cm). I never dealt with cramping or discomfort. Battery life is pretty dang good, I haven't had to charge since I bought it and started using it last Friday (About 5-6 hours of use a day). Overall, I had no real issues with the mouse in game. **\*EDIT\* I Found English Driver!**

**Overall Thoughts:** My overall thoughts about the X3 are that it is a pretty decent little mouse if you are low on funds. Is it anything that shakes up the market or adds something we haven't already seen? Not at all. Is it worth $40? I would say so. It will be in my rotation moving forward, and I am hoping its durability stands up with the test of time."

# BUTTONS

**Main Clicks** 

The main buttons use Omron optical switches. These are by far the most solid and poppy feeling implementation of opticals I've tried so far. The clicks are a little stiffer/medium tensioned out of the box, but after a week, they're tensioned around the lower end of medium, or higher end of low. I've had this mouse for 3 weeks now, and the click-feeling has continued to remain consistently great throughout. They have a satisfying, somewhat high pitch pinging sound and feel quite crispy when spamming. The pre-travel is extremely low-to-nonexistent, and post-travel is a satisfying enough amount to give them a nice bounce and quick rebound. There will be an extremely minor amount more post-travel felt when clicking from the very front of the buttons, but I honestly think these feel perfect. 

**Scrollwheel & Side Buttons**

The scrollwheel has quite a few differences from previous lamzu mice. The notches are more defined, and have a slightly more ratchety sound and feeling, while also being a little more loosely tensioned. The width of the scrollwheel is slightly wider than the atlantis mini and maya, but still features the same infinity pattern along the ring. As for the scroll click, it's tensioned similarly to the regular maya – so on the lighter end. I find it quite satisfying and addicting to use, so definitely an upgrade in my experience.

The side buttons have a slightly rounder profile than the regular maya. The regular maya is more flat in the contact area, while the ones on the maya x are curved. This makes them easier to access and actuate by rolling your thumb up, though I do have to lift my thumb to press the front side button cause of my hand size and grip style. The side buttons on the Maya X have a tiny bit more post-travel than the regular, but are still decently satisfying to press nonetheless.

# COATING, CABLE, SKATES, & WEIGHT

The coating on the Fnatic Maya X seems grippier than it is on the Fnatic Thorn, and works better in my opinion, and closer to the regular coating. It's still slightly warmer than the regular lamzu coating, but other than that, I don't really have any complaints. The skates are the same great ones that lamzu usually uses. However, there is a tiny upgrade to the adhesive application. They now use an adhesive layer/pad on the skates, which I assume is to ensure they stick more consistently onto the base of the mouse. This gives them a whiter appearance at the center where it's applied, and a translucent look around the outer edges.

The cable is the same flexible one they use for all their mice, and I consider it to be one of the best stock cables available. Lastly, the weight shows exactly as advertised on my scale at 47g. The build quality is flawless with zero creaking, flexing, rattling, or any sort of button sideplay; one of the reasons lamzu remains one of my top brands.

[How the skates look](https://preview.redd.it/p6k92ahdl0ld1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1970d881be870840a644d8c1e3c4fab3b683219)

# SHAPE

My hands are 19.5x10cm and I use a [relaxed pincer claw grip](https://i.imgur.com/sin7VRe.png). Before describing the shape, here's how I grip the Fnatic x LAMZU Maya 8K:

[contact points & grip style](https://imgur.com/a/L1BBQHV)

The Maya X is a large-sized mouse, while the Maya (non-x) is mostly catered towards small to medium sized hands. I usually lean towards smaller shapes for my own specific preferences, but I am surprised by how comfortable and easily adaptable the Maya X shape has been to use despite that. You can check the dimensions on [eloshapes](https://www.eloshapes.com/mouse/compare?p=LAMZU-MAYA-X-vs.-LAMZU-MAYA-4K) to get a rough idea of the difference. It's much wider, longer, and slightly taller. The physicalities can be felt in the areas of contact it makes with my hand. The X has safer, more neutral-angled/flatter sides, while the non-X's sides taper quickly/sharply towards the base of the mouse, which makes it less safe than its larger counterpart. It's noticeably more spacious to place my ring, pinky, and thumb along the sides, and that makes it so flexible for me to hold it in different gripstyles. Whether it's relaxed claw, aggressive claw, a slanted grip, holding it farther forward or backward, or even fingertip, the space it provides allows me to always make enough contact to feel fully in control while holding it.

As for differences in the hump, the changes on the X aren't too drastic. It feels mostly the same, but in a taller and wider profile, and leaves my hand in a wider stance when gripping it. The hump on the X is a little bit bumpy/square as it reaches the edges of the sides, while on the regular, it feels much rounder and transitions more smoothly. This helps lock in your palm so you can freely place your fingers along the flatish sides. In contrast, the regular Maya's tapered sides lock in your fingers, while its hump lets you loosely position your palm more freely on it. That isn't to say the X's hump is restrictive in any way. It's spacious enough for me along the top of the hump to still shift around and place my palm where I want when determining how I want to grip it. Overall, its shape is just extremely comfortable and natural to grip in multiple ways. I still prefer the smaller maya and atlantis mini more cause of my bias towards thinner gripwidth, but its versatility is what makes this the best large shape I've tried so far.

# SOFTWARE & BATTERY LIFE

To use the 8k dongle, and for the mouse to be detected, you need to download lamzu's crystal wireless software. Everything in it has the same appearance as the usual software they use, so navigating through it should be intuitive. The mouse lasts around 1.5 days at 8khz with moderate use, and 3-4 days at 4khz. You can find what the led colors mean in the manual included in the box. It states that at 20%, the led will blink red to indicate low battery – though I found it starts to blink closer to around 16%. While charging, it blinks purple, and at full charge, it remains a steady blue.

"The Lamzu Maya X is a bigger version of the original Maya and TLDR this is together with the VV3p and Scyrox v8 is in contention for mouse of the year.

[the shape is clean AF](https://preview.redd.it/zkeheg1lt2vd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0c75f12ec0d882ca3b533d530f43e25b221af18)

*Specs, Batt life and Cleanliness check*  
This mouse is THE hottest mouse right now. Imagine standing out amongst all the amazing products out in the market today. The Maya X is 3950 8K with the newest Nordic chip and Omron optical main switches. It's got a web UI and works seamlessly without a hitch.  
After the firmware update i got 3 days /31 hours on 2K polling and 5-6 days and 65 hours on 1K polling.\*\*edit\*\* after latest firmware update I got 40hrs batt life on 2K polling.   
as for the cleanliness check - I have the black version so the smudges and finger oils do show up on the surface and does not dissipate easily and unfortunately this is the same issue almost all black mice owners face, personally i'd pick a white or maybe the fnatic orange version to circumvent this problem.

*Shape and size*  
Some say it's an updated gpx shape and to some extent it's true. I would describe it as a gpx with lower triggers and of course superior clicks.This shape is truly what my big hands like as a 'small' mouse. When the Maya arrived I realized that I prefer this size more than the other small shapes that I was used to(ATK & Scyrox)  
So right now, it's the VV3P and the MAya X that'll be the 2 mice that I will use as my main Ambi mouse.  I can't decide which one I like better, some days it's the Viper some days it's the Maya X.

*Build Quality*  
The build quality on the Maya X is on par with logitech or Razer, and to get that kind of solid feel is why i think it's 7-8g heavier than the madr and scyrox.  
Maybe inner structures or increased thickness added to the weight but i think they made a good choice because you can really feel it in your hand, the sturdiness of the shape and it feels like it's more dense or has thicker material, even the triggers feel more rigid and anchored securely to the body.

[smudges less severe than the old Maya](https://preview.redd.it/cmal7b9fy2vd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=006186aa914c2234ec456ea04f04ba49640c89bc)

*Coating*  
This has the standard Chinese rubberized coating that almost all CN mice use. It's smooth and dry to the touch and gets progressively sticky as you warm it up. Because I have a black copy, the smudges and finger oils are fairly noticeable but I have to add that it's not as annoying as some other brands. It's very minimal but I feel with a black mouse this is unavoidable.

*Buttons*  
M1 and M2 are omron opticals and this is the goat of all switches. RIP Huano BSPD. Because of the rigid structure of the plastic itself, it's added to the overall satisfaction of the clicks itself. Just like the Beast X with the rigid magnesium triggers, it just made the omron opticals even more satisfying to actuate.  
It feels light and fast, it feel precise and instant and that rigidness means you can feel that consistency across the entire button, and this means it works great for any kind of grip style.

[best ptfe feet as usual](https://preview.redd.it/92rpitjt13vd1.jpg?width=2987&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d083b3d84a4e75f39d4de64d25a781ba9a519d11)

*Feet*  
The Lamzu PTFE feet are awesome, they have always made great stock feet and they continue to do so. I bet they pay more for their skates than logitech does and this shouldn't go unnoticed by the consumers.  
You're buying a GTR with Pirelli P Zeros whereas on other mice you're getting the equivalent of Kumho tyres. I had the Original maya and the skates were kinda puffy, I suspect they used a different material or grade of PTFE but on the Maya X it looks like either they got a new supplier or used a different method of preparation before they installed the skates on the mouse. It's different and it's better.

*Performance and Value*  
I got a PB on my first attempt on Kovaaks and subsequently maintained the highest performance coming close to my PBs all the time, even while rotating 10 mice and and 10 pads over tha last month. I would certainly be breaking records more regularly if I dedicate more time and not swapping out gear so often.  
As for value, $120 isn't too much to ask for a mouse of the year isn't it? If they came down to $100 i think they will sell more than they can produce.

I also made a [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjQ_HLwEFZc). Say hello in the chat :)"
