"Microsoft and Meta just dropped a major announcement at Ignite 2024: Windows 11 is now available on Meta Quest mixed reality headsets. This move promises a new way to use Windows in a virtual office, blending desktop productivity with immersive environments.

Here’s the pitch: You can access your full Windows desktop while collaborating in Meta's Horizon Workrooms, all within the Quest ecosystem. Microsoft says it’s a step towards hybrid working 3.0.

But here’s the big question: Will people actually use this? Or is it just another attempt to sell mixed reality to businesses that might not be ready?

While it’s cool tech, challenges like hardware adoption, user experience, and whether companies will invest in VR headsets over laptops remain hot topics. Could this finally push MR into the mainstream workplace, or is it destined to be a niche tool?

What’s your take on this? Are we witnessing the future of work, or is this just another shiny tech announcement without legs? (Literally 😃)"

**The problem:**

Searching files using explorer now takes EONS.

This happened since the last feature update, when they changed the explorer search behavior (new tab).

Searching for something like \*bunny\*.\* in my cute animals(Yes I have photos of that, fight me!) directory. It used to show the results almost instantly, now the greenbar goes for almost 15, 20 or even hours with no result. Rarely the search goes correctly AND displays results.

Interestingly there is almost ZERO activity on the hard disk im trying to search. It used to use 100&#37; of the hard disk before. (Its like the process is stalling or doing something it shouldn't. One core is pegged to 100&#37; when doing the search.

Other issues: the Indexing Options obviously is corrupted, its always anything ""*Waiting to receive indexing status..*""

[its been like this for almost 1 hour...](https://preview.redd.it/iqixzxtg2r911.jpg?width=531&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d1cb17fe9bdc3254aae9060137db57b12b9a5e0)

""*Modify*"", ""*Pause*"" are disabled, the included locations list is completely empty. and clicking on ""*Advanced*"" will cause the program to completely hang up and only way to close is by using the task manager.

The Windows Search service is running. but seems to have no effect if its turned off or on.

Sometimes the Explorer is even worse, directories that I haven't visited in a year no longer show thumbnails.

Restarting the device resolves this issue (of the thumbnails) but the Search service is still in a non working POS mode.

Additional problem: When searching.. before I could search in many explorer windows at same time. Now I cannot search in more than 1 window. The other explorer windows will stall until the first is done.

[Windows search now stalled, because im searching in another instance...](https://preview.redd.it/ij78joq43r911.jpg?width=2561&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b829268437d10b6e4d1aaedfd6f0c1987a6aa956)

*SFC* Scannow and Windows Health were rebuilt and reviewed with no errors reported.

I tried to use a technique that involves deleting the  WINDOWS SEARCH in RegEdit and importing a proper working machine's keys. But even when taking over the registry key, it does not allow me to delete or modify.

Last time I had a bug like this, the only goddarn solution was to reinstall everything ( I swear the more Microsoft adds to Windows 10, the buggier it gets. Reminds me of Windows ME now because of how many problems its giving lately..and god forgive you if something goes corrupt, because there is no solution and the microsoft forums is full of India reps who repeat the same cooked up list... All while not even reading the problems or the things that you tried already)"
"I have a folder named ""Pictures"" containing tens of thousands of pictures that are organized in sub-folders named by date such as ""2020-04-07"". Some of these pictures have been taken by DSLRs, mobile phones or are just computer screenshots. I dump pictures every day using a script that transfers the images to subfolders by date and tags it via the Exif tool Exiv2 based on the source (e.g. mobile, screenshot, etc.). I don't always have opportunity to review these pictures which results in a significant number of images I've never seen before.

My goal is to have an image viewer application that works like a digital photo frame for your desktop and randomly displays images based on filters as a slide show in a resizable window. I have tried and bought many applications but they either function exclusively as a screensaver, only displays in fullscreen or lack critical functionality to be useful for my purposes. I am looking for an application with the current features:

**ISO A paid or free application compatible with Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 that can**:

1. Display images as a slideshow in a resizable window on the desktop and maintain aspect ratio (NOT as a screensaver).  
Note: I have a multi-monitor setup and would like to be able to place the application on any monitor and view images as I work in other applications.
2. Display images recursively from a folder and its sub-folders.
3. Filter images by exif fields such as keywords / tags (e.g. mobile, screenshot, etc.).  
Note: I want to be able to include or exclude images with tags such as ""screenshots"" or photographs with tags such as ""onsite"" that denote pictures for work.
4. Randomly display images.
5. Displays the displayed image filename -or- provides an option to open the location of the image.
6. Provides on-screen controls (i.e. previous image, next image, pause, play) -or- provides hotkey shortcuts to do the same.

Out of the 20 or so applications I've tried the closest I've come to achieving the desired result is gPhotoShow and forcing it to resize with a specific monitor position using AutoSizer. I would prefer that the software be a standalone or portable application but I understand that processing thousands of images may make that impractical.

Here are some of the titles I've already tried: XnView, FastStone Image Viewer, Wega2, gPhotoShow, Artsee, FastPhotoTagger, ImageEye, ImageGlass, HoneyView, VoidImageViewer, Able Photo Slide Show, IrfanView, ArtSage, AmoK Exif Sorter, Imgv (Image Viewer), QuickViewer, SuperSlide, PhotoSift, WildBit Viewer, Random Photo Screensaver, Adobe Bridge, DigiKam, FastPictureViewer, Zoner Photo Studio, etc."
"I have a scheduled meeting on Microsoft Team 2 hours from now. Last time, while I could listen, my voice was not audible.

Here is the screenshot of the setting. Using Microsoft Windows 10 on desktop and Logitech webcam. When camera is turned on, video is working. But there is no way I could find to test if my voice will be audible prior to the meeting.

Under Settings, it seems the audio is working:

Maybe during the last meeting, in Microsoft Team, Logitech webcam was not selected for which my voice was not audible:

It seems right now the setting is okay. Is there anyway to test check on Microsoft Team that the voice will be audible once the meeting starts?

Since I will be using headphone, it appears configuration for headphone too needs to be done. Not sure if this is the correct way by choosing headphones under Output.

After plugging in headphone, there is now Headphones option under Audio Settings | Speaker. The same selected.

Based on the above settings, the meeting went smoothly and I was audible."

"can anyone review my cbs logs and help me diagnose and fix my issues on a fresh windows 11 install and new hard drive?  


Last week my hard drive containing my OS failed and was not salvageable. I purchased a new m.2 drive along with 2 additional SSDs.

I attempted to use my usb drive containing windows installation media which apparently corrupted and I received the error about drivers missing when attempting to install. I purchased a new usb drive and used a friends PC to create a new installation media via windows download.

I was able to use the media to install windows on my new m.2 drive and things worked well for about 24hrs. Eventually when rebooting my pc would enter repair mode and finally came to an SRT Trail error. I attempted several recovery methods including system restore and command prompt (fixboot) but was unable to resolve my issues. 

I have now reinstalled windows three times on two different hard drives after reformatting them. After installing windows updates I continued to run sfc scan and receive errors. I attempted to use DISM /restorehealth and /restorehealth to a windows iso image with /limitaccess. All attempts failed. The DISM ... /restorehealth command freezes at 62.3% and the /limitaccess tells me that the DISM file is not available.

Please follow the link here for PC information, screenshots, and a new CBS log.

"""There’s a problem with Microsoft Windows App Runtime DynamicDependency LifetimeManager. Reinstall the application from its original install location or contact your administrator.""

I'm really not all that computer savvy, I've tried doing a few things that I found online and it didnt work.

I was thinking it was something from a windows update and it would just go away but its been weeks now. 

I tried repairing, reseting, uninstalling and installing the newest version of ""Microsoft Windows App Runtime"" and that didnt do anything.

Earlier today it did do something different where it brought up the microsoft store, so it seems like the issue is something to do with the store. I tried searching online to see if i could perhaps disable the store to make it stop but i found stuff saying that it could negatively impact the system.

My real confusion is how this hasnt been fixed by windows, I know tons of people have had this issue and surely windows doesnt expect everyone to be a computer wiz.

If anyone has suggestions Id greatly appreciate it because this is annoying."

"EDIT: Unbiased in relation to PROS vs CONS (not going to only say good or bad). I can't believe I actually have to say this. 

Hi, this was deleted from /r/microsoft by a moderator, so I thought I'd share with the world instead of just Microsoft. I thought it was unbiased, but apparently Microsoft just wants pros: sorry Microsoft.

Hi,

I am a software developer and IT guy, MTA certified, A+ certified, and have been using Windows since 3.1:

There are major pros and cons that hold very high extremes. This Windows is still in production, so I'm sure things will change -- I am hopeful that they will change, in fact, so don't let so many cons get to you, as there are many pros as well! 

Let me start with the cons 1st:

**** CONS ****

    1.  Admins are not admins. 

That is to say, even admins with UAC turned all the way off: UAC is still secretly at 3/5 instead of 0/5, unlike Windows 7. This makes even the most basic tasks troublesome for an admin that knows what he's doing:

* Deleting files doesn't prompt UAC or even an ""are you sure"", but moving a picture to a folder, then clicking UNDO will trigger UAC, like the overburdening motherly love, ""ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THAT?!"" Chill windows... I am just undoing a .jpg move from desktop to my pictures folder! 

* Opening Visual Studio doesn't let me be an admin of my OWN created apps! It doesn't tell me until after I try to compile ""You require admin privs! Restart?"" And any dev knows that restarting visual studio when you just got settled in is burdening. I set shortcut as admin, but sometimes if I want to start it via start menu, a different shortcut, directly... I have to set them ALL to run as admin (or go to source .exe, but you know, I shouldn't have to is the point).

* Anyone that goes to cmd prompt probably knows what they are doing - esp if an admin account. Nope! I can't do my favorite winkey+R >> cmd to start cmd fast via keyboard because I don't have admin rights! Again, I am signed in as admin. I have to go to a shortcut or hold shift or other burdening processes. Similar to above, I have to set multiple admin workarounds.

* I edit an .ini file for a game, which is very common for settings changes even for casual users. Not even a UAC prompt! It simply will not let me, as if it's write-protected. I had to go through loops to fix this.

* All of the above examples were when UAC is supposedly OFF in an ""admin"" account.

    2. Unnecessary bulk

* In Windows 7, the wifi selection screen is a tiny bubble that, non-instrusively, takes up 5-10% of your screen. In Windows 10, it takes up 40% of your screen (an improvement from an early build taking up 60%, where most of it is whitespace). There are other UI bulks like this, but I am hoping it will be improved.

    3. Customization options are fading

* For the 'start' menu, or even the favorites pins on the left side of file explorer, Microsoft thinks for you: You can't arrange it the way you want it. Windows will force your icons alphabetically, or to the side where you didn't want it to drop. I have hopes this will change later, but for now it's a bit frustrating.

* You are more-or-less forced to create a Microsoft account for new users. I just want to make a simple account for my wife, but it ends up turning into this huge process.

* Cortana forces you to search using Bing with no alternatives. I am HOPING this will change, but so far it has not. This is one sample where I feel that Microsoft Windows is slowly turning into ""Mac"", in a sense that you get less freedom with your customization. If you don't like Bing search, then too bad (although I use a Chrome app called ""Bing2Google"", which redirects these requests -- Sorry to advertise this, Microsoft, but I really believe you should let the user choice, as you've always done with any feature in Windows before 8.

     4. Start menu + Search is slow. Really slow, and a bit unintuitive

* Ok -- I know this is a ""work-in-progress"", again, I have faith this will change. But for now, it's almost unusable -- If I search for ""chat"" hoping to find Hipchat, my results are this (after a ~3 second delay, compared to 0.2 second delay in Win7):

http://i.imgur.com/LXuJdtv.png

* ^ Now this is very embarrassing -- Not only is hipchat not found, but it prioritizes internet, random searches for Chatroulette , random no-extension files, and misc system files before even suggesting hipchat.exe -- Local files (especially exe) should ALWAYS come before internet. Adding internet search first is what causes the search delay.

     5. The beauty is fading

* Windows has always had this beauty about it, like a different flavor of Mac, since Windows 7. I mean XP was not the most pretty OS, but Windows 7 was surely something. Now everything is flat, no shadows, boring. I mean, the trash can looks like it was made with HD-MSPAINT. To compare, it feels like Windows 3.1 HD (Yes, my first OS was Win 3.1). We finally support the gfx acceleration for some stunning beautiful interfaces, but all we have now is flat and boring. 

* I DESPISE Mac (they are a greedy company that locks down their system for use only for browsing the internet and nothing more, in my opinion), but I have to say, they do their interface right (well, for their desktop OS, not their mobile-iOS which is just an app drawer OS to me). Keep the beauty, Win10! Make it flat, but how about a hybrid of flat + shadows/glow/opacity? I like the start menu change in last update where some opacity was added. It's a start! But that trash can icon... lol :)

    6. Not-very-intuitive admin settings / login screen

* I'm sure this is changing every build, but for now it's very troublesome. If I go to my network adapters and double click, of course I want to configure my IP settings, NOT choose a wifi network or i would have done it from my desktop tray or network and sharing center. When it comes to how windows is updated, the settings branch off into very odd categories and other control panel options are very similar to this. I am confident this will change.

* The login screen changes often, so again I want to emphasize this may be changed -- But for now, it is very pointless to slide a curtain up to login, which is essentially, ""a lock screen for a lock screen"". Not to mention the 2-second delay before I can enter my password, even if I swipe fast. This needs to go away (or have the OPTION to).

** ok, now for the PROS **

    1. Finally, multiple desktops!

* Yes!! This means you can separate your work and leisure desktops or have separate projects going at the same time. This is good for work, good for casual, good for any type of user. Linux has had this for a long time (and probably Mac too, but I wouldn't know) and I'm so happy it's here. It seems to be pretty intuitive even for an early build, so I have high hopes for this and already use this.

    2.  Task manager groups together multiple processes, gives more info, and is more intuitive

* Oh man, when it comes to Chrome.exe, all of their 200 instances are grouped in 1 like a hierarchical (is this a word?) folder so easy to manage. Then even startup apps and services, all in one place. Task manager compared to 7 is a Godsend.

    3. Icons are HD (No this isn't in any particular order, so it's not #3 most important lol)

* This sounds like something small, but when you stare at a computer screen for 8 hours+ a day, any form of pixels starts to hurt your eyes. Ever play a super nintendo game after being used to Skyrim? It doesn't look like how you think in your head. We are spoiled by HD (probably better for our eyes) and I'm happy with my HD :) Everything HD = good. Keep it coming!

    4. Powershell is built-in!

* Oh yes! With powershell, I can do more with my system. I can install it separately, but it never hurts to have it there without even trying. I was able to get my Chocolatey distro installer so easy with this :)

    5. Maximizing apps is actually intuitive now! File explorer is better!

* Maximizing apps will shrink the title bar down a bit and sometimes even the top bars will hide. Clicking on my computer will actually now show your drives + basic docs, pics, and vids again (last build had so much bulk and didn't even show drives). By default, the extra ""extra large buttons"" were minimized by default for a more windows-7 feel. Overall this feels like an upgrade without the bulk it used to have.

    6. Compatible with ""everything"", easy to upgrade, better system cleanup

* Windows 10 is actually a windows update, and free! Don't forget to google how to free up the upgrade files or you'll lose over 40gb of precious SSD space! When you google this, you'll be surprised to see that Windows' built-in system cleaner is actually ore like ccleaner now and will clean junk beyond the average junk! This includes leftover windows installers and windows 10 upgrade itself! I've saved a good 50gb with this utility, which is 1/2 my space on the average SSD!

** SUMMARY **

I've said pros, I've said cons. I've been very honest, blunt, and to-the-point. I'm unbiased, only biased against Mac products as I've hinted, so I'm 100% a Microsoft guy. That said, if I were to choose right now, what would I do?

Well, I'd say, if you are reformatting anyway, and you have 2 computers, put your less-used laptop on Win10 and put your main desktop on Windows 7. Windows 10 still isn't there yet, and the restrictions are overwhelmingly frustrating for an admin ""power user"", if I were to put it in a Linux term. That is, if you don't want to get prompted every 5 seconds for even the most common of tasks, even with UAC off, stick with Windows 7. This makes reinstalling a nightmare, especially, because you'll get hundreds of prompts for doing quite literally anything. 

Installing on a client computer? Win7 is still king while Win10 is in production, but Windows 10 is REALLY nice for security -- UAC is so overwhelming, like a Tiger Mom, it will keep clients from doing stupid things. This also means that they will complain to you more often about popups for everything they do. It's buggy though, screen freezes, and it's not meant for commercial use. You can see there's definitely potential for future, though.

If you are using Win8 or 8.1 I would say hands-down get win10. Despite the bugs, I preferred Vista over Windows 8 or 8.1, even. It's a major upgrade that compromises Win7 with Win8.1, although again, the UAC ""admin"" restrictions really urks me to the point that I may not even use 10 in release if they don't release a ""i know what i'm doing mode"".

That is my unbiased review of Win10 production build :)

And a special note to any Microsoft dev reading this:

> Please, Gods of Microsoft, grant us a REAL ""admin mode"", like Win7 had (Yea, I can disable EnableLUA in registry, but that causes issues with modern apps)! That's all I ask! Please don't stoop down to Apple's level and assume we're all dumb users. Thank you."
"My main machine is a 2012 gaming PC that has been continuously updated and runs Windows 7. Overwhelmingly, I still use this for most of my online games (Warframe, PSO2 NGS, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy XIV -- which still worked as of a couple years ago when the Endwalker expansion came out). 

Meanwhile, I have had 3 separate computers running Windows 10 and encountered a variety of problems that I've never had on any Windows 7 machine. Most of my tech friends think I'm crazy, which is probably true. But I'm curious if I'm still right just the same.

I wanted to reach out and get some peer reviews on what functions and features in more modern Windows OS you find upsetting. I'll start:

\-

While I hear many complaints about forced telemetry, my chief problem with Windows 10 is the forced and self-healing ""update"" services that appear to be interlocked and install unwanted software features, always unannounced and oftentimes throttling system resources while performing intensive processes such as video rendering or gaming. 

Anyway, here's where things get invasive: in earlier versions of Windows 10, you could more readily disable or force automatic updates into manual mode and control your schedule by managing the Windows Update under the Services application. However, over time Microsoft added the Windows Update Medic Service, which you can only disable via the Registry key. Disabling this will not be the end of your nightmare, however: Microsoft has also added the Microsoft Windows Health Service, which while I assume this runs some separate part of the process does appear to also have a hook into the aforementioned services that will reactivate them. 

Now, you would think that deactivating these should be enough to resolve any issues. But you'd be wrong. Windows Edge appears to also have some sort of piggyback function that will locate system dependencies and prompt the system to begin updating them. Microsoft Edge likewise has 3 separate update services that also operate interdependently. And if that's not enough, the Microsoft Store has its own hooks into the system update process so far as I am aware.

\-

I do local troubleshooting as a side-gig and many older folks will get some of these Windows 10 updates which forces them to log in with a Microsoft account and/or pin number that they cannot recall because it is not something they have interacted with more than a couple of times and simply do not have written down. These house calls tend to be straightforward account recovery activities that, for what they do on their computers, simply has no need to ever happen at all. 

And those are the lucky ones: since most of these computers are cheap prefabs from places like HP or Dell that are 6+ years old, some of these updates will brick the machines by either rendering the drivers unserviceable or overriding drivers with ones that are actually not at all compatible. These obviously require a rollback on system restore, but the problems generally show up again as soon as the update sneaks its way back on their machine at some point. These are people living on retirement: it is unreasonable to ask this demographic to keep replacing their machines when the hardware itself operates just fine.

This level of invasiveness on user control leads me to believe Microsoft wants so badly to be Apple, pushing their OS as a service instead of a product, that they are willing to sabotage users to keep the most ignorant ones (the average user) investing in the same product even when it hasn't outlived its service life. 

This is why I've stuck with Windows 7 -- not because it's less resource heavy or lacks forced telemetry, but because I am not having to fight the operating system itself to \*not\* run what I tell it not to.

Addendum: I've had the SuperFetch service consistently clog up disk read/write resources on two separate Windows 10 laptops over the past few years. It used to be a simple task to disable it, and it still is but for one caveat: Microsoft at some point decided to actually \*disguise\* the service by renaming it into the highly deceptive title of ""SysMain"". That's schoolyard levels of griefing."
"I've been searching through CPU's, to eventually replace a crippled motherboard of mine, and I found that the drivers for most of the I-9's, I-7's and I-5's between Q1 2017 - Q4 2020 that in addition to ""Windows 11"" & the many versions of ""Windows 10"" that ""Microsoft Windows"" is supported. 

For example: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/199325/intel-core-i710700kf-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/downloads.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/199325/intel-core-i710700kf-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/downloads.html) 

I don't know what they mean by it, its not included on the 2023 processors I've seen and I haven't seen it on the older models from 2016. I remember going through the processors a few months back and could have sworn that they said Windows 7 is supported. What gives?"

"Hi, I just go this old laptop (fujitsu amilo xi 3670) from a pawn shop and decided to buy it and use it for retro gaming since it got some old NVIDIA gpu with 512mb.. but yeah that was the plan till the first chock which is windows no longer let you download win7 ISO file but that's fine I just went to 1337x. to as usual and downloaded an untouched win7 ultimate sp1 untouched ISO and installed it on the machine.

Here when things kept getting messier and messier. first thing I found out is that the browser doesn't show up the webpage even if it is connect to the internet. thought it is just the browser is too old to handle https and nowadays web so I downloaded the browser from my phone and installed it and it worked pretty fine. then when I tried updates it gave me 0x80072F8F error and even when I searched about fixes online and downloaded some updates from Microsoft it didn't work. I tried downloading steam to test albion online performance on this game but when I downloaded it it gave me error cannot connect to steam server for updates. tried all the fixes online but didn't work. I downloaded a VPN and it also gave me similar error. when I downloaded the third game and gave me the same error then I started to smell something fishy.

So I figured out the problem maybe is in the ISO that could be not really untouched haha so I went again searching online for other download and verified it and i installed the version that the laptop got a key label for it on the back of it. when I tried to verify it it gave me a similar error that when I googled I found this subreddit by a thread that's pinned here. I tried the fix that it said but it didn't work and said that the update is not applicable to your computer.

Here I'm making this post waiting for someone to help before I decide to dump this idea and sell the laptop or let it rust as others that failed me lol"
I wanted to ask this because I wanted to do some emulations in VirtualBox. Where do you get official Microsoft windows 7 ISO files from?
"**Update:** I've added some additional information about CAL licensing, as there's some entitlements based on Microsoft 365 licensing options. I've also added a section about licensing considerations when clustering, both physical clusters (e.g. SQL Failover Clusters) and virtualization clusters (e.g. vSphere Clusters).

**Update 2**: It's now [up in the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/wiki/ms/licensing/windows_server) as well, for those who would like to link to the full guide so you don't have to dig into the comments for section 3.

Hi All! I've seen a number of posts over time asking for advice on how to license their environments with Windows Server. I thought it might be helpful to write up a ""primer"" on Windows Server licensing for those who are newer to Microsoft Licensing in the sysadmin world. All of this information is available directly from Microsoft in their [Licensing Briefs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/learn-more/volume-licensing-briefs), which are an excellent resource, but I know they can be confusing for those not previously experienced with Microsoft Licensing and its nuances.

What follows is based on my experience over the past 16 years between working for a non-profit, a MSP that sold OEM, Retail, and Volume Licenses, eventually even became SPLA licensed to provide hosted services, an enterprise environment, that underwent official KPMG-run Microsoft Licensing Audit that held both multiple types of Volume Licenses (Open Value vs Open Business) and even an Enterprise Agreement (EA), and my current position that in an organization that holds an EA for all Microsoft licensing.

Now a **Disclaimer:** I'm not an official Microsoft Licensing representative, so if you believe my information is incorrect, please let me know and I'll do my best to fix the post or clarify a point. Also, this isn't meant to suffice as a be-all-end-all for Microsoft OS licensing, more of a general beginner sysadmin's guide. And with that, you should always run your licensing questions by the Microsoft Licensing Specialists at your preferred VAR. If you don't have a VAR for Microsoft Licensing and have been basically doing it all on your own, I recommend you setup business relationship with one of the big VARs like Dell, CDW, or Insight and ask for a Microsoft Licensing review. (And if you happen to be a VAR yourself, but you're smaller and don't have a dedicated Microsoft Licensing team, reach out to the team at your preferred distributor for licensing questions).

I'll break it down into 3 main sections:

1. Windows Server OS Licensing
2. Windows Server OS Virtualization Licensing
3. Windows Server OS Cluster Licensing ([Down in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qc63ie/comment/hhg0y2n/) because of post length limits)

I didn't include Windows Desktop OS licensing in this guide because it gets complicated with a lot of the newer options out there like Microsoft 365 E3/E5, but I will add this ***very important*** note: Don't think you can just buy a Windows 10/Windows 11 license and run it in a VM. The base Desktop OS retail or volume license mostly **does not include virtualization rights**. There's very specific licensing that must be used for virtualizing the Desktop OS. See the [Licensing Windows Desktop OS for Virtual Machines Brief](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/8/D/98D6A56C-4D79-40F4-8462-DA3ECBA2DC2C/Licensing_Windows_Desktop_OS_for_Virtual_Machines.pdf) for those details.

I'm also writing this with the assumption that you are licensing as an end-user organization and are **not** providing hosted/cloud services to individuals or businesses outside of your own organization. If that's the case, then you should be under a Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA), which has it's own set of complexities.

I'll start with a quick glossary as well as there are some common terms used throughout Microsoft's licensing:

## Glossary

**OSE** = Operating System Environment (The installed OS software whether physical or virtual)

**CAL** = Client Access License (License required by the client user or device accessing the server)

**SA** = Software Assurance (Entitles you to version upgrades, and some other items; usually lasts a period of 2 years, then you have to renew to maintain it)

**Windows Server Core** = GUI-less version of Windows Server for reduced security and disk footprint

**Windows Server Desktop Experience** = Windows Server with a full GUI experience

# 1. Windows Server Licensing

At the most basic level, properly licensing Windows Server **requires 2 things**:

1. Physical-Core-Count License of the OS software
2. User and/or Device CALs for users and/or devices accessing services on a Windows Server OS

As for those requirements, there are no ifs, ands, or buts about them. I'll start at the basic level as if we're licensing a single physical server (with no virtualization):

## Windows Server Editions

Windows Server comes in 3 editions:

* Windows Server Essentials
* Windows Server Standard (Core/Desktop Experience)
* Windows Server Datacenter (Core/Desktop Experience)

Let's look at the different editions and how they're licensed.

## Windows Server Essentials

Windows Server Essentials is specialized edition that is extremely-limited and designed for very small environments. It has a hard-limit of 25 user accounts and 50 devices, is licensed per physical CPU socket, with a maximum of 2 sockets, regardless of CPU core count, is limited to 64GB of RAM, and doesn't require User or Device CALs. It's generally meant for small mom-and-pop type operations that won't grow beyond that size and only need something like simple Active Directory and a file server for, say, QuickBooks sharing. On the note of Active Directory: if the Essentials edition is your Domain Controller, it and only it can be a domain controller. Basically it's meant for a very small environment with a single physical server with no requirements for virtualization. General recommendation amongst those of us experienced with it: RUN AWAY. DO NOT USE IT. But it has it's use cases, and if it fits yours or your client's, then it's a perfectly fine option.

## Windows Server Standard & Windows Server Datacenter

These are the editions of Windows most sysadmins experience. They're the more ""fully featured"" editions with effectively all Windows Server features available. These versions of Windows Server, since the 2016 version, are now under a Core-Based licensing program. This means that the Server OS software license is based upon the physical core count of all CPUs in an individual physical server. There are a handful of specialized features that are only fully unlimited in the Datacenter version, but both Standard and Datacenter are licensed the same way in the Core-Based licensing program.

## Downgrade Rights

Now here's another thing to know about Windows Server licensing. When you purchase a Windows Server license, you receive what are called Downgrade rights. What this allows you to do is run an older version of the Windows Server OS than what you have purchased, or a lower edition of the OS than what you purchased. The downgrade rights are technically limited to the 2 previous versions of the OS if you purchased your license via Retail (or Full Packaged Product) or OEM Channels. If you purchased through Volume Licensing, you can effectively downgrade to any version of the Server OS dating back to Server 2000.

Where this comes in handy is third-party applications. A lot of applications take their sweet time upgrading to support newer versions of the operating system. So sometimes a company will purchase a license of a piece of software, but the latest version of operating system they support is actually older than what is commercially available. (Say they support Server 2016, but not Server 2019).

Let's take a look at what these downgrade rights get you in terms of what you can run, based on which version and edition you have purchased. Top row is the purchased version and edition of Server OS. The left column is the version you're allowed to run with the table entries showing the editions you're allowed based on your ""up-level"" license.

||Server 2022 Datacenter|Server 2022 Standard|Server 2019 Datacenter|Server 2019 Standard|Server 2016 Datacenter|Server 2016 Standard|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Windows Server 2022|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|||||
|Windows Server 2019|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|||
|Windows Server 2016|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|
|Windows Server 2012 R2|Datacenter  / Standard^(†)|Standard^(†)|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|
|Windows Server 2012|Datacenter / Standard^(†)|Standard^(†)|Datacenter / Standard^(†)|Standard^(†)|Datacenter / Standard|Standard|
|Windows Server 2008 R2|Datacenter / Enterprise / Standard^(†)|Standard^(†)|Datacenter / Enterprise / Standard^(†)|Standard^(†)|Datacenter / Enterprise / Standard^(†)|Standard^(†)|

**†** Anything marked with the dagger (^(†)) above means that you need to be licensed under a Volume Licensing program in order to qualify for those downgrade rights. And because of how Reddit table formatting works, it applies to every edition listed in the cell that has the ^(†) symbol.

To obtain actual media and license keys for downgrade rights, if the license is OEM, you'll need to request the media and license from your vendor. They sometimes charge a small fee for it to cover the cost of the media and shipping. If your product is Retail/FPP, you can contact the Microsoft Activation Center to obtain media and license keys.

So you'll see that if you purchase the Datacenter edition of the Server OS, you can run either Datacenter or Standard on your installation. And you'll see for each version (2022/2019/2016/2012 R2), you can run the previous 2 editions of the operating system based on that license. Generally, Volume Licenses are allowed to downgrade to any version of the Server OS dating back to Server 2000.

Now, on to the meat:

## Core-Based Licensing:

When calculating your requirements for Core-Based licensing, the core count of your license must match or exceed the number of physical CPU cores you have in each individual server. Count only physical cores; logical cores, created by functionality like Intel's Hyperthreading, creates additional threads that Windows sees as ""logical cores"", but those additional threads are **not** counted in licensing requirements.

Core-based Server OS licenses are sold in 2-core ""packs"", with a minimum purchase of 16 cores per one physical server, working out to 8 ""2-core packs"". This requirement is the same for both the Standard and Datacenter editions of Windows Server.

Examples:

* Have a server with a single-socket, quad-core CPU that you want to run Windows Server Standard on? Welp, it sucks, but you have to buy 16 cores.
* Have a dual-socket, 10-core CPU configuration (meaning each CPU has 10 cores)? You need 20 cores worth (10 packs) of licensing.
* Have a dual-socket, 12-core CPU configuration with Hyperthreading enabled? You only need 24 cores worth (12 packs) of licensing.

## User/Device CAL Licensing:

User and Device CAL licensing is the same as it's always been. How you account for and decide on which licenses to use varies based on your environments and use-cases.

On a general basis, it's usually safe to count the number of users who connect to your network and use any piece of software on any server running Windows Server (Microsoft software or third-party doesn't matter, if it runs on Windows Server, a CAL is required for access), and then purchase that many User CALs.

One very important factor: you must purchase the same version of CAL as the OS you are licensing, or greater. Let's look at some examples:

|OS Version|CAL Version Required|
|:-|:-|
|Windows Server 2022|Windows Server 2022 User/Device CAL|
|Windows Server 2019|Windows Server 2019 or 2022 User/Device CAL|
|Windows Server 2016|Windows Server 2016, 2019, or 2022 User/Device CAL|
|Windows Server 2012 R2|Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, or 2019 User/Device CAL|

Also, you don't have to re-purchase CALs for every individual server you license. You only have to purchase them **once** for each version of the Server OS you are using.

So say you already have a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 in your environment and have 50 Server 2012 R2 User/Device CALs. Now let's say you want to add a second server running Windows Server 2019. You will need to buy 50 new Server 2019 User/Device CALs to match the new server version. Six months later, you decide you need a third server running Windows Server 2019. You already purchased 50 Server 2019 User/Device CALs with the first Server 2019 OS purchase, so you're covered. You don't need to purchase any additional CALs unless you have increased your number of users or devices accessing the 3 servers.

Now, deciding on whether to choose a User or a Device CAL can be complicated. Here's some scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** Your company has 50 employees, 10 of which are executive/management. The company has 50 desktops in a one-desktop-per-user configuration, and 10 laptops for your executive and management staff (so execs/management have 2 PCs each).

**Scenario 2:** Your company has 100 employees, 40 of which are admin/management/executive staff, and 60 of which are employees of your 24x7x365 call center. You have a total of 70 PCs: 40 desktops for your admin/management/executive employees who all have mobile phones, 10 laptops for execs/management, and 20 desktops for your call center. Your call center is staffed in a 3-shift rotation, where only 20 people are working in the call center at a time, and each single workstation is shared between 3 people across the shifts.

**Scenario 3**: The same as Scenario 2, but we're adding 3 Multi-Function Printers into the mix. Two of them are only used by admin/management/executive staff, but one of them is used by the call center staff. Your MFPs get their IP addresses from your Microsoft Windows DHCP server, and they use the DNS services on your Domain Controller because they're configured to be able to scan a document to a folder on your file share.

**Scenario 4:** Your company runs a insurance plan. The user and PC count for your staff is similar to Scenario 2. You also run a web portal in-house using IIS (or Apache/Tomcat/Nginx/etc.) on one of your Windows servers (not in the Cloud or provided by a hosting company) tied into your back-end systems where people can manage their insurance policies. You have 5000 customers with accounts on this portal.

Okay, now let's think about what licensing we want to choose for each of these scenarios:

In **Scenario 1**, you're best served by purchasing 50 User CALs. A User CAL covers accessing any Windows Server device by the assigned user from an unlimited number of clients (PCs, tablets, mobile phones, etc.)

In **Scenario 2**, you're likely going to want to purchase 40 User CALs for your admin/management/executive staff, and 20 Device CALs for your call center PCs. Because there are only 20 PCs for use by call center staff, you're hot-desking your 60 call center employees between the 3 shifts, you can license those workstations by Device instead of user, since your call center staff will never have more than one PC assigned to them and will never access your system with more than one PC. This allowed you to only have to purchase a total of 60 CALs instead of 100, thus offering cost savings.

In **Scenario 3**, you've now run into one of the biggest, and most frustrating, in my opinion, ""gotchas"" with Microsoft CAL licensing: Microsoft deems that **any** user or device that uses **any** service running on a Windows Server OS, it **must** be licensed with a CAL. Because your MFPs are getting their IP from Microsoft DHCP and using Microsoft DNS, those devices must be licensed. Because 2 of them are only ever used by the admin/management/executive staff, the User CALs assigned to those users covers licensing of those 2 MFPs. **BUT**, because you have 1 MFP that is used by your call center staff, and you opted to use Device CALs to license their PCs, that MFP will require a Device CAL.

In **Scenario 4**, things get interesting. Just like in Scenario 3, **any** user or device that uses **any** service running on a Windows Server OS, **must** be licensed with a CAL. Because of this, in addition to your 100 employees, those 5000 customers with portal access need to be licensed with a CAL. Now, before you get worried and think, *""OMG, do I really have to buy 5000 user CALs to cover all my customers?""*, the answer is no. ""*But, you said they* *must* *be licensed.*"" That's because there's an additional license type that can be purchased called the **External Connector License**. This license is purchased **per physical server** for when you have External Users accessing your systems. What is an External User? Microsoft's [CAL licensing information page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/client-access-license) defines ""***An external user is a person who does not have employee-level access to your company’s network or the network of your affiliates, and is not someone to whom you provide hosted services.***"" So effectively customers, and customers only. Contractors are considered employees for the purpose of the EC license. The External Connector license **CANNOT** be used to license your internal users, affiliates, or contractors.

Now the EC license is decently cheap, in the overall scheme of things, but may have some sticker shock if you're not used to seeing it. If memory serves, it's usually about $1,500 USD per server. But considering User CALs are around $80/each in Scenario 4, $80/CAL x 5000 Users = $400,000. The $1,500 option is quite obviously is a much better choice for you here. If you're in this kind of scenario, you should really speak to a Microsoft Licensing specialist with your preferred VAR to make sure your bases are covered.

As a helpful note on the ""every user and/or device must be licensed"" front:  It's highly, *highly*, ***highly*** recommended that you do **not** use any service running Windows Server for your guest networks (like for DHCP or DNS). Because each and every person and/or device that connects to said guest network would then require a CAL of some type. Technically you could purchase an External Connector License to cover those users, but that's likely a waste of money when you can likely provide the same functionality through DHCP and DNS services using your switches, routers, and external DNS providers.

Okay, now that I've made your head spin with considerations and requirements for choosing CALs, here's some additional both helpful and confusing information:

If you have opted to purchase any of the following Microsoft Cloud products, they include what is called a CAL Equivalency License:

* Microsoft 365 F1 / F3
* Microsoft 365 E3 / E5
* Microsoft 365 A3 / A5
* Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security E3/E5

**Note:** The Microsoft 365 products above are **not** the same as Office 365. [Microsoft 365 A3/A5/F1/F3/E3/E5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise) specifically refers to Microsoft's Cloud offering that includes both Office 365 and Windows 10 Enterprise/Education licensing (and a few other products) in a combined product for a monthly or annual fee.

So if you've opted for one of these licenses to get your users both Office 365 applications and the Windows Desktop OS, congratulations! That user now has a CAL and you don't need to purchase an additional one for them.

There's also a couple of other CAL licensing options out there called the **Core CAL Suite** and **Enterprise CAL Suite**. These are bundled CALs for a bunch of different Microsoft products like Server, SQL, Exchange, SharePoint, and Microsoft Endpoint Manager (formerly called System Center Configuration Manager, or SCCM for short.

If you want more info on what CAL Equivalencies you can get, see [Microsoft's Product Terms for it here](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/CALandMLEquivalencyLicenses/).

Okay, are you thoroughly confused yet? Because now we're going to dive into Virtualization Licensing.

# 2. Windows Server Licensing in Virtual Environments (VMs)

At a base-level, Windows Server licensing for VMs works just like above, with some additional considerations and caveats, and it all depends on which **edition** of Windows Server you're licensing, and is **not** affected by which Hypervisor OS you are running. Meaning these considerations are all the same whether you use Hyper-V, VMware (ESXi/Workstation/Fusion), Nutanix, Proxmox, KVM, RHV, Citrix Hypervisor, VirtualBox, Parallels, etc.. The ""advantage"" of running Hyper-V is that it's a pretty full-featured hypervisor included with the Windows Server OS and doesn't cost extra to use, and has full native-VM backup functionality included, so you can use backup applications like Veeam or Commvault (unlike with VMware where the free edition of ESXi doesn't include the backup APIs, so you can't actually perform native VM backups and instead would have to use some sort of agent-based backup inside the VM OS).

As with before, the 3 different editions of Windows Server:

* Windows Server Essentials
* Windows Server Standard (Core/Desktop Experience)
* Windows Server Datacenter (Core/Desktop Experience)

The each edition has different virtualization rights outlined below.

## Windows Server Essentials:

Windows Server Essentials does technically allow for virtualization, but the license is either/or; meaning you can run the license on the physical server, or you can run it in a VM, but you cannot do both with the same license. (An example of running it as a VM: Say you choose to run VMware ESXi as a hypervisor on the physical server. You can then run the Server Essentials OS in a VM, but you only get one VM.)

## Windows Server Standard / Datacenter:

Now Windows Server Standard and Datacenter both allow for virtualization, and each license allows the following per each physical server:

|OS Edition|Number of VMs (OSEs) Per Physical Server License|
|:-|:-|
|Windows Server Standard|2\*|
|Windows Server Datacenter|Unlimited|

\*For each physical server you license with Windows Server Standard, you are licensed to run two (2) OSEs/VMs on that physical server. There's also a special use-case with Standard: You are allowed to use that single physical server license to *also* run the Windows Server Standard operating system as the hypervisor OS on the physical hardware, **if** and **only if** that installation is used to manage the Hyper-V role (and VMs) on that server. So, that *technically* means you get 3 OSEs, but it is very specific in that you **cannot** run any other applications in the OSE running on the physical hardware than what is used to manage Hyper-V (this doesn't mean you can't run things like AV. It just means that the OS is only licensed for the purpose of managing VMs running on that piece of hardware).

Now, say you need to run more than 2 VMs on a physical box, but you don't need **unlimited** VMs. In order to become licensed for additional VMs, you must purchase additional core packs of the Server OS license. For each additional fully-licensed set of cores, you receive 2 additional VMs.

So, say you want to run 4 VMs on a 20-core server, and you want to use Windows Server Standard. You need to purchase 40 cores worth of Server OS licenses. So mathematically, it works out to

**( (Number of VMs rounded-up to the nearest multiple of 2) / 2 ) \* Number of Cores**

Want 7 VMs on that 20-core server? First round up to the nearest multiple of 2, which is 8, then multiply by 20 cores like so:

(8/2)\*20 = **80 cores**

The breakeven point on this is usually at 13 VMs. If you're getting to a point where you're starting to run 13 or more Windows Server VMs on a single physical server, you should switch to Windows Server Datacenter licensing instead.

# [3. Windows Server Licensing in Clustered Environments](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qc63ie/comment/hhg0y2n/)

Because of issues with post length limitations, I couldn't include this section in the actual post, but I've laid out scenarios for how Windows Server Licensing works in Clustered environments [down in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qc63ie/comment/hhg0y2n/).

# Appendix 1: Remote Desktop Server Licensing

Remote Desktop Services, formerly known as Terminal Services, and usually referred to as RDS, is a Windows Server Role that allows for multiple simultaneous (or concurrent) users to be able to remotely login to a single server and work in that environment. Many are familiar with this through services such as Citrix (aka XenApp or Workspace Virtual Apps and Desktops), or VMware Horizon.

While Remote Desktop Services is included in the Windows Server operating system, it is separately licensed on a per User or Device basis **on top of** the Server Core and Server CAL licensing, similar to Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft SQL Server.

Many people get confused with licensing for Remote Desktop Servers. A lot of people believe that if you purchase a RDS CAL, then you don't need to purchase a Server CAL. This is **incorrect**. Every user or device you purchase an RDS CAL for must have an accompanying Server CAL. RDS licenses are considered ""additive"", as in additional-to the base-line Server CAL.

Another mistake people make is ""*well, I'm using Citrix/VMware Horizon, I don't need to purchase a RDS CAL because I'm not using Microsoft's RDS*."" That's also **incorrect**. Citrix Workspace Virtual Apps and Desktop, and VMware Horizon actually use Microsoft RDS at an underlying OS API level and even require the RDS Role to be installed on the Server. So, as a result, they require Microsoft RDS CALs to go along with their own individual licensing.

RDS CAL licensing follows the same pattern as OS CAL licensing. You must purchase the version of CAL associated with the version of OS you are intending to use. Downgrade rights also apply:

|OS Version|RDS CAL Version Required|
|:-|:-|
|Windows Server 2022|RDS 2022 CAL|
|Windows Server 2019|RDS 2019 or 2022 CAL|
|Windows Server 2016|RDS 2016, 2019, or 2022 CAL|
|Windows Server 2012 R2|RDS 2012, 2016, 2019, or 2022 CAL|
|Windows Server 2012|RDS 2012, 2016, 2019, or 2022 CAL|
|Windows Server 2008 R2|RDS 2008 R2, 2012, 2016, 2019, or 2022 CAL|

# Appendix 2: Software Assurance

If your company likes being on the latest-and-greatest versions, and is able to keep your systems frequently updated, Software Assurance may be a good option for you. Or even if you want to maintain newer licensing to prevent from larger long-term costs if you keep a frequent upgrade cadence on your systems, it's a **very** cost-effective option.

Software Assurance is Microsoft's name for ""upgrade protection"" or ""software maintenance"", and is available only through a Volume Licensing program. When you purchase it and keep your SA Agreement current/active, you are entitled to/licensed for the latest version of the software for which you've purchased SA.

It's generally offered as a 2-year agreement with your license, so 2 years after the initial purchase, you must renew it in order to maintain all the rights and entitlements granted by SA.

Price wise, it's generally 50% of the initial purchase price of the license, and it **must** be purchased with the initial license purchase. So say your Windows Server Standard 2022 license is going to cost $1069. If you want Software Assurance, it'll add roughly $535 to the purchase price of that license, for a total of $1,604 up-front. In 2 years, to maintain SA, you'd renew at that 50% license price of $535.

Over time, if you are one to keep your environment updated with newer versions of the OS to keep up with modern technology and security, it can much more financial sense to pay for Software Assurance than to continually re-purchase full licensing.

There's also a number of usage rights you gain with SA, particularly 2 that I'll call out:

* Disaster Recovery Rights
* Mobility Rights

Disaster recovery rights let you keep standby servers around for disaster recovery purposes and let you temporarily transfer the license to that piece of hardware while undergoing restore operations.

Mobility Rights can refer to 2 different sets of rights, depending on which product you're talking about. For Windows Server OS, Mobility Rights basically means that you can ""move"" your license to a Cloud Service Provider's infrastructure and not be charged a monthly Microsoft licensing fee from said CSP. In SQL-land, it also refers to the ability to move a Core-licensed virtual machine from one physical host to another without having to license the full host for SQL Server on top of Windows Server. But since SQL is outside the scope of this guide, I'll just leave it at that. Check out some of the guides and Q&A documents I link below for more info there.

# Summary

So that's Windows Server licensing. For greater detail on Windows Server Virtualization licensing, I'd recommend checking out the [Licensing Microsoft server products for use in virtual environments](https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/D/4/3D42BDC2-6725-4B29-B75A-A5B04179958B/Licensing_brief_PLT_Licensing_Microsoft_server_products_for_use_in_virtual_environments.pdf) brief and the [Licensing Windows Server for use with virtualization technologies](https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/D/4/3D42BDC2-6725-4B29-B75A-A5B04179958B/Licensing_brief_PLT_Licensing_Windows_Server_for_use_with_virtualization_technologies.pdf) brief.

All of Microsoft's Licensing briefs, including those two are available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/learn-more/volume-licensing-briefs).

Another good resource, recommended by u/ComGuards is [this document](https://squalio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SQUALIO-FAQ_July2020.pdf) from [Squalio](https://squalio.com/), an IT Services Provider located in Latvia. I've looked through it myself since he linked it in the comments and I find it to be an excellent source for a lot of licensing questions.

I'm also personally a fan of [Mirazon's](https://www.mirazon.com/) licensing breakdowns on their [blog](https://www.mirazon.com/category/microsoft-licensing/). They hold Gold and Silver level [competencies](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partner-dir/ab50da1a-20ae-4d70-99a4-f5119811fd66/overview) as part of Microsoft Partner Network, and I highly trust their advice.

**Edit**: I cleaned up some broken line-break formatting in the Glossary section that happened when I first published, and fixed some redundant and unclear information in the virtualization section about the Server Essentials edition."
"Hello,

We are using a test PC called pc-test, running Windows 8 (Version 6.3, Build 9600). Multiple users have access to this machine, but at any given time, only one user can connect. We have enabled Remote Desktop Connection on this PC.

Here’s the situation:

When a user (e.g., abc) is logged into the test PC, and another user (e.g., xyz) unknowingly tries to access it, a prompt appears on user abc's screen stating:

***""Another user is currently logged on to this computer. If you continue, this user has to disconnect from this computer. Do you want to continue?""***

This prompt gives 30 seconds to either allow or deny the connection.

We want to monitor how many times users attempt to log in to the pc-test while it is in use. Specifically, we are looking for:

**1. Is there any Event ID that logs when this prompt is generated in abc user's PC?**

**2. If no specific Event ID exists for this prompt, what is the best method to monitor login attempts to the same PC, especially when another user is already logged in?**

This is because we are having a requirement to log such cases and get the count of occurrences where this prompt is shown. We would like this prompt to be there, so disabling the prompt and allowing other user to directly connect by disconnecting the former user's session is not an option.

We have already reviewed the Event Viewer logs, but it is unclear whether this specific login attempt (with the prompt) is being recorded.

List of event IDs we checked : 4624,4625,4634 in Microsoft windows security.

Any help or guidance on which Event IDs to monitor or alternative methods for tracking these login attempts would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your assistance."
"I am currently working on configuring the CIS Benchmark L1 Member Server settings for Windows Server 2022. In the CIS Microsoft Windows Server Benchmark Build Kit ReadMe file, I came across the following line, and I am unsure where to install the mentioned component. Should it be installed on all member servers where this configuration will be applied, or only on domain controllers or both?

'*Prior to applying a Build Kit, ensure that the most recent version of the Microsoft Windows 11 Administrative Templates (applicable to both workstation and server OS versions) has been downloaded directly from Microsoft and installed on the system.*'

  
Additionally, in the L1 Member Server configuration, there are 324 settings available. I understand that not all settings are suitable for every infrastructure. If someone has reviewed all 324 settings before, could you please let me know which configurations are complex and may cause issues, such as breaking legacy applications or disrupting network or performance-related services, so that I can test them carefully or avoid implementing them?

For example, I notice that some of these CIS configurations involve enabling certain audit logs on the server. Will this result in a significant increase in event logs? If we have log collecting agents and EDR systems on the servers such as Zabbix, LoginSight, or CrowStrike, would these agents consume more processing power and network resources due to the additional logging?

If this CIS configuration is accidentally applied and causes issues, can changing the GPO settings back to normal fix the issue? What would be the easiest and best way to revert the changes on applied machines?

  
TA."

"Would like a review of the hardware I picked up.

**Mobo:**  I've done a lot of research and think I understand the basics, but keeping track of all the possible mobo's has me wondering if this MSI board is going to nerf the Ryzen 9 9900x I picked up at MicroCenter ($359).  Also no clue if it has the new USB 4 (40 Gbps... or GBps?) headers.

**RAM:**  I thought RAM was RAM.  I pick DDR5 in white if possible, don't care about the RGB, and I want 64GB (2x32).  Dude at Microcenter told me the RAM in my build list was designed for AMD boards.  Noticed later when Amazon had it for way cheaper (219.99 vs 170.99) that it listed XMP and no Expo.

If anyone has any suggestions, most of the other parts are *probably* too old to return.  The 2080 Super is unbranded out of an old Alienware box.

**Build Purpose:**

**Multipurpose,** Gaming, Browsing, Coding, Data Crunching, Davinci Resolve (rare, home movies type deal), basically want the ability to game and run whatever productivity I can think of.  Gaming is 100% non-competitive, single player gaming, Cities Skylines 2, Starfield, Fallout N, Borderlands N (host LAN co-op), Foundry, The Planet Crafter, etc..

**GPU Reuse:**  I'm insanely indecicive, and right now just want to hold out for RTX 5000."
"I was gifted some new egg gift cards that have quite a bit of money on it. I’m currently running AM4 and I believe I’ve upgraded this platform as much as possible. While I do love having the latest and greatest, is it worth it? I’m digging the reviews of the 9800x3D. At the very least these gift cards could get me a new motherboard and ram and I could easily sell my mobo/CPU/ram combo to put towards a new CPU.

"Hello,

&#x200B;

I am looking for a new motherboard to replace the current one I had to return.  I am disinclined to return to Asrock.  I thought I was deadset on buying the MSI MAG X670E Tomahawk... But then, I started reading more.  And everytime I pick a new choice, I stumble upon user reviews, here, or somewhere else, saying this board, or this other board I pick is garbage.

&#x200B;

Trying one last time to help me chose.  I am in Canada.  


Price is not the most important factor.  Computer is used for gaming, possible file server and a bit of work, though I have other computers for that.

&#x200B;

Once I am finished transferring my data and I'm sure everything is working right, the Seagate HDD will be gone, and so will the EVO SSD.  Until then, there are a adjustements to be made, and other data transfers for another computer to be made.

&#x200B;

I'll be replacing my video card with... something.  I'll *wait and bleed*.  When the time comes.  No need to spend 1300$ on a video card without a working computer.  Especially when I'm just dying to play *Galactic Civilization IV*...  Not exactly the most challenging game for a GPU :)  


Now onto the motherboard.

&#x200B;

I am not that attached to price.  That does not mean I am going to pay close to 900$ CAN for a motherboard, but I won't be going to cheapen out on the mb to save 20-30 or even 50$.

&#x200B;

Nearly all my back USB ports are used and I have a small 4 port usb hub that is all used (should have got a bigger one, I miscalculated).  


I'm not using thunderbolt atm, but that does not mean I won't be using it in the future.  Might as well have a port or two.  


Wifi6e is useless to me. My house is somewhat large and the router will still be distant once I've moved it closer.  Eventually, I'm going to have a Wifi 7 router and some Wifi 7 adapter for this computer and I have no idea when or what shape it will be.  I'm disinclined to pay a premium at this point for a mb that has Wifi7 built in, and having Wifi6e in an mb is not a selling point but they all seem to.

&#x200B;

USB Gen2 header, ideally 2x2 is nice.  Near essential.  Front USB connectors for the case.  


No need for great sound, I now have a dedicated sound card.

&#x200B;

Obviously, given my cpu, no overclocking is necessary. Even without the 7800X3D, I wouldn't overclock, I guess.  I just killed the Rizen 3 on my HTPC trying to overclock it, not taking anymore chances.  28 Days without drinking, I can do it no sweat.  28 Days without gaming x 3, I'm getting tired, and cranky.

&#x200B;

I've been well served by Asus products over the years.  I like the BIOS.  Have one Asus board for my HTPC too.  Had one for my AM4 since Ryzen 1st gen, Asus Crosshair VI Hero, it lasted until last October when the PCI-slot died, likely due to multiple electrical problem.  My UPS died first, then the PC.  Careless of me.  Had other Asus boards before that for Intel, great boards too.  I have an MSI board in the office, a cheap B350.  Except for the lackluster BIOS (which is ok for an office comp.), it's an ok board, but I'm not asking much of it.  I've had another Asrock in another machine that as worked well, but this was my first Asrock gaming board.  Not impressed.

&#x200B;

I'm hesitant on where to go with the board.  MSI X670E Tomahawk?  Asus Rog Strix X670E-A Gaming?  Pay much, much more for a Gigabyte Aorus Extreme?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, here is the list, except for the motherboard I need to change:

"No responses on r/buildapc when I posted, so re-posting here. First time building a PC here and am wondering on how over-spec'd I am for what I plan to use it for, as well as where I can cut back. I'm really looking to get back into music production with Ableton and maybe some old-school games on Steam. Certainly nothing like major AAA games today. Was initially looking for around a $1,500 budget but willing to go over/under to be cost-effective. Would love any advice on cutting back and if anything looks off please feel free to shout it out! Thanks!

Few reasons on some of the parts

Intel I9 -> I figured if I want this build to last a while, it would be helpful to pay up here, especially as I can cut back on the GPU compared to gaming rigs. Novice obviously but understood the amount of cores helps with the multi-tasking in Ableton. Certainly can cut back here if people have favorite CPUs they think get the job done

Storage -> I was always told that it was helpful to put your OS and Ableton on one SSD so it puts up super fast, then everything else on separate storage. Not sure if that's still the case or if it's just as easy to buy 1 '2 TB' SSD instead

GPU -> This had good reviews without it being top of the line. Figured it could handle any older game without issue.

Case -> I think I could get away with a mid-tower but went full in case I wanted to upgrade

Fans -> Assuming I don't need 3

"This post started as an attempt under the AMD sub's megathread, but apparently it's too big for it to be posted as a comment. I'm the the end of my rope here. Hoping this will also raise awareness of the issue. 

**Summary of the issue**:

There is a persistent Driver Timeout issue (PC freezes although audio is still working properly for some time, screen turns black, after a wait it all comes back up) with World of Warcraft that I cannot get fixed no matter what. The issue is most prominent when using DirectX 12, with settings maxed out and MSAA x8 + CMAA 2. It's a guaranteed driver timeout when running a ""Dawn of the Infinite: Galakrond's Fall"" M+ dungeon. While using DirectX 11 certainly does alleviate the issue, it does not completely eliminate it. Same goes for lowering graphics settings - while it will make it less likely, the issue is still present and it is very, very disruptive to gameplay.

**What I have tried to resolve the issue**:

* All driver versions ranging from 23.11 to 24.3.
* Fresh Windows 10 and 11 installs.
* Using two separate 8-pin PCIE connectors, either headers.
* DDU or AMD Cleanup Utility, with Windows Updates disabled and installing graphics drivers offline.
* Reinstalling Chipset drivers.
* Installing driver only.
* Installing monitor drivers.
* Installing all kinds of drivers Gigabyte Control Center suggested.
* Various motherboard BIOS versions.
* Reseating GPU.
* Reseating RAM.
* Reinstalling CPU cooler.
* Changing the PSU cable.
* Disabling fast boot both in Windows and in BIOS.
* Changing Power Plan to Full Power or Balanced.
* Power flushing the system.
* Removing the CMOS battery.
* Disabling Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling in W11 Graphics Settings.
* Disabling Optimizations for Windowed Games in W11 Graphics Settings.
* Disabling Variable Refresh Rate in W11 Graphics Settings.
* Disabling Memory Integrity
* Disabling Kernel-mode Hardware-enforced Stack Protection
* Disabling AMD SVB in BIOS.
* Disabling/Enabling MPO.
* Disabling SAM.
* Disabling EXPO.
* Disabling FreeSync.
* Disabling FreeSync on the monitor.
* Setting DP mode to DP 1.2+HDR or DP 1.2 (without HDR).
* Removing Gigabyte Control Center.
* Installing MSI Afterburner to do the next two:
* Disabling ULPS via MSI Afterburner.
* Enabling “Erase autosaved startup settings” via MSI Afterbuner.
* Changing from DP cable to an HDMI cable.
* Enabling or disabling various graphics settings in Adrenalin.
* Removing WoW from Adrenalin's Games tab.
* Performing Scan & Repair via [Battle.net](http://battle.net/)
* Re-installing WoW altogether.
* Clearing Shader Cache.
* Moving the GPU's physical switch for different vbios profiles to any position (0 - software controllable, 1 - Performance Mode, 2 - Quiet Mode).
* Both the SSDs are installed in the PCIe 4.0 slots of the motherboard - the PCIe 5.0 slot has been left empty for future upgradability.
* Installing the game on either SSD.
* Returned the GPU to retailer, they returned it back (They only ran benchmarks and played a bit of Fortnite & Cyberpunk...)
* Took the PC to a technician, they couldn't recreate the issue - they were using a low-end 1080p monitor though. They also didn't find any other issues with my system.
* Borrowed a friend's [Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 12GB](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N3060GAMING-OC-12GD-rev-10#kf) \- I did not have any issues playing the game at all. Some flickering issues in Chrome and in Clipchamp.

**Things worth mentioning:**

When I first built my PC, the first few days the weather was awful and it did shut down twice but has not shut down ever since. [This article](https://hwbusters.com/psus/be-quiet-pure-power-12-m-850w-psu-review/11/) mentions that the OCP is very high, so maybe this is something I should have worried about before.

It seemed like for a few days my PC worked perfectly fine and then all hell broke loose. Maybe I was just lucky with the issue, maybe something else changed.

While installing the side fans, I did press on the GPU 8-pin power cables a bit, but switching the headers didn't fix the issue, so it doesn't seem like damaged power cables might be issue.

If too many driver timeouts occur in a very short period of time, it will result in a BSOD that mentions DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE. The BSOD seems to be related with leaving the AMD Issue Detection window open in the background - for example if I ignore it and neither close the window nor fill out the bug report and send it.

Wifi connectivity with this motherboard has been shaky - it occasionally will lag out for 2-3s, but there doesn't seem to be any correlation with the timeouts. Not sure if this is any indication of a defective motherboard.

**AMD support** has been unhelpful at best. Aside from suggesting all the regular troubleshooting steps, they then pointed me towards communicating with the game developer. At some point though I received the following: *""I checked internally and found that this issue has been reported internally and is currently under investigation. However, there is no timeline to when the investigation will be completed. Therefore, I would request you to wait for the future driver releases and test it.""* \- This has been during version 24.3's lifetime.

**Blizzard support** was even worse. They barely pay any attention to their tickets anymore. They suggested the regular troubleshooting steps, did not recognize the issue, pointed me towards communicating with AMD even after insisting that AMD told me to contact them instead and hastily closed my tickets.

The issue has been around for the 7 months I've owned my 7800 XT but other users claim it's been around for well over a year. Either AMD or Blizzard do not seem to care much about the issue or the issue does not affect a lot of users. Occasionally 1 guy will pop in every post, saying they don't have any issues at all, which is mind-boggling.

Other titles I've tried playing include Hogwarts Legacy, Baldur's Gate 3, PUGB, all without any crashes. League of Legends in Fullscreen mode gave me one small freeze when alt-tabbing constantly (I only use 1 monitor, so) which was resolved with switching to Windowed (Fullscreen) & one very specific enemy player blast caused the game to slow down horribly and audio to get choppy but still didn't result in a crash.

Overall, this all comes with a massive letdown. I've tried raising awareness about the issue but no influencers aside from [Wendell](https://www.youtube.com/@Level1Techs) have taken any interest in this. All of the Youtubers seemed to praise AMD at the time for finally having good drivers and good performance at the right price. At this point I've spent so much time troubleshooting this issue that I could have justified a 4090 instead."
"Hi Everyone!

So, I’m a little out of my depth and I’m looking for help on a new PC build.

**Background, feel free to skip**

I’ve built five different PCs in my time, but only two of them were true “gaming PCs,” the last of which was in Christmas of 2015. I used to be into gaming and mostly spent my time playing Diablo, Left 4 Dead, Civ, etc. Life got in the way and I didn’t have as much time to dedicate to gaming so it fell to the wayside. Most of my PC time these days has been your normal PC tasks (internet, movies, word processing, etc.) but I do spend some time doing processor-intensive tasks like 3D modeling.

I started with the PC Part Picker guide for the Magnificent AMD Gaming build and then swapped out some components I’ve had my eye on for the last few years. To go with this, I also have a Samsung CRG9 monitor and the Logitech MX Master 3 keyboard and mouse that I use when I WFH but I’m not opposed to swapping out the keyboard and mouse if there are good reasons for doing so for a more gaming-specific setup. I finally got to the $3k price range and don’t want much more than that which is where I need the help.

**The build**

**Some additional info and background on some of the swaps:**

· I wanted an AIO cooler for the cleaner aesthetic, and then saw the AIOs with the built-in temp display and really liked the functionality. I know this could be done in other ways with small monitors, but this is a clean simple solution that scratches the itch.

· I swapped out the motherboard for something that was all black to better go with the look I wanted. I don’t need the wifi functionality since this will be hard wired but from what I could find, the MSI Tomahawk was a nice solid choice.

· I’ve never been into the big deployment of RGB but I did want something to light up the inside of the case and so I went with the G.Skills Trident Z5 Neo RGB

· I don’t really remember why I ended up going with the Gigabyte Windforce version of the 4070 Ti Super but I think this was down selected based on cost, color, and reviews from the PC Part Picker guide.

· I’ve always been a fan of the Fractal Designs cases and this go around I really fell in love with the North. I saw it in a MicroCenter and thought it was a little small for what I wanted so I upgraded to the XL version.

· The only thing I was unable to add to the build on PC Part Picker was the Flex B-20 I wanted to add to mount the graphics card in a vertical orientation.

**The Ask**

I’m generally looking for feedback on the overall build, any issues or known problems, and if there are value-added benefits to swapping out components. I don’t really have a budget for this—I’m not planning to go out and play pro-level on AAA games so keep that in mind—but I wouldn’t mind spending a few hundred extra dollars for something that will let this PC last for several years without upgrades.

I’m also interested in insight on what I should be concerned with on the build itself. Do I need anything for the RGB to function? Do I need fan controllers? Do I need to look at adding more fans than the stock front mounted 3x140mm and the top mounted AIO with 3x 120mm for airflow? Is mounting the graphics card vertical a super dumb idea?

Thanks for the input!"
"Hello Everyone, 

following system I have:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz   2.60 GHz

RAM	32,0 GB

GEFORCE GTX 1060 

Samsung 870EVO 1TB

Samsung 970 EVO 1TB

It's not bad for a notebook, after some years, it's getting difficult to work with Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop and recent games. I work often on RAW photos and it takes a while to apply some effects in Photoshop or after I edited the photos, to export them from Lightroom. I'm living in Germany btw.

The look of the system is not relevant, since the PC will be haning under the table. I just want the best power for my money and to work in peace for the next 4-5 years.

I would also great to have some power capacity for Adobe Premiere, since I cut only videos at work, because the notebook can't handle 4k videos well.

(I also would like to play some physic intensive games like BeamNG etc.)

My target price is about 2500-2750€, but if it's reasonably I could go up to 3k+€.

Following stuff I've chosen:

Processor AMD Ryzen™ 9 7950X3D, Processor € 699,0

Mainboard ASUS TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI, Mainboard € 331,00

Processor fan Noctua NH-D15S chromax.black, CPU cooler € 109,90

Memory Kingston FURY DIMM 64 GB DDR5-6000 (2x 32 GB) Dual-Kit, Memory € 247,90 

Graphics card Gainward GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Phantom, graphics card € 849,00

Hard disk (SSD) SAMSUNG 990 PRO 2 TB, SSD x2	€ 177,90 = € 355,80

Hard disk (SATA) Seagate FireCuda HDD 4 TB, hard disk € 159,90

Case DeepCool MORPHEUS , Tower case € 149,90 ( white case would be awesome)

Power supply DeepCool PQ1000M 1000W, PC power supply  € 159,90

Windows Microsoft Windows 11 Pro OEM, operating system software  € 159,90 

**Together it's about  € 3.222,20** 

I'm not a market expert, so I've just choose the stuff with the best reviews online, on a webbsite.  
Are the anythins, I could improve, so I get a good price power ratio?  
I don't care about RGB light or some special stuff, just a white case and that's all.

Thanks in advance for your advice and suggeestions.

"Long time lurker, first time poster, forgive any posting transgressions.   My son for Christmas this year has been dropping hints for a gaming rig (he even sent me his own parts list, via email as a proposal...what a kid), I've decided to get him the parts and show him how to build his own.  I started building PCs for my own gaming use back in the 90's so I know enough to make a build happen.  But my last build was quite some time ago...i5-2500k, GTX 980ti (typing that out I realize Dad needs an upgrade!)...so I'm unfamiliar with the newest chipsets and could use some input on the parts I've picked.  

This will be strictly a gaming rig for a 13 (and a half as he likes to remind me) year-old as he has a laptop for school already.  My goal is to get him solid introductory base parts that give him a viable upgrade path over the next 5 years as he figures out what his passions are.  I traditionally have stuck to Intel/Nvidia but am not opposed to going the AMD route.  Budget wise, while I don't mind spoiling the boy, w/monitor I'd like to keep it under $1k but I have failed at that cause shiny things.

This is what I have pulled together:

I am obviously over-spending with this build but have looked at so many reviews I am in information overload at this point.  I feel like the B660 chipset would limit future CPU/GPU upgrades?  I know I could save $ by dropping to 3060 GPU but I know enough to know the GPU is always the bottle neck.  Have also considered just going with the PCMR 60 FPS Build, but I am just so unfamiliar with AMD, or pcpartpickers Great Intel Gaming Build."
"Hi all! I'm new to PC gaming and I wanted to build my first computer as a summer project. I used PCPartPicker to make a build and I was wondering if someone could review it!

"So, I'm sort of new to the whole PC building thing, that being said I've been playing games on pc for a while now. The only thing is I bought an iBuyPower PC 4 almost 5 years ago from Walmart. While it's rocking an intel i3 CPU with a 2060 GPU it been running fine for the few games I have played. I'm looking to build a pc way better than that with quite a budget ($2,500). The games I would like to start playing in descent quality are NFS Heat, NFS Unbound, Call of Duty MW2 (currently runs about 50-60 fps in warzone with the 2060 and i3, blew my mind). I would like some advice as to what I could improve on in my current pcpartpicker list.

Current List:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7 GHz 12-Core Processor - $339.99

CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i RGB Platinum SE 240mm AIO (White) - $152.13

MOTHERBOARD: MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk ATX AM4 - $169.99

MEMORY/RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 2x 8GB DDR4-3000 CL16 (White) (I'm getting 2 of these for a total of 4 sticks and 32 GB of RAM) - $113.98

STORAGE: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 3.0 NVME Solid State Drive - $184.85

STORAGE: Seagate Barracuda Compute 2TB 3.5'' 7200 RPM Internal Hard Drive (Also getting 2 of these, as I do a lot of ARK server coding and you can never have too much storage) - $99.98

VIDEO CARD: Zotac GAMING AMP GeForce RTX 3060 12GB Video Card (White) - $419.99

CASE: Anidees AI Crystal Cube Mesh Front Panel AR V3 Dual Chamber EATX. (Case is not on pcpartpicker, it's on amazon). - $199.99

POWER SUPPLY: Corsair RM750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply (White) - $121.99

OPERATING SYSTEM: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (seen a lot of bad reviews on windows 11) - $139.88

CASE FAN: Antec Fusion 120 ARGB White 57.93 CFM 120mm Fans 5-pack (getting 2 of these packs, 10 fans total as the case can support 12 fans total). - $159.96

GRAND TOTAL: $2,102.73 out of $2,500 Budget. (So, there is still a little wiggle room to play with)

If you are willing to look this over and give me feedback on what to change, please try to keep in mind the build I'm currently trying for will be all BLACK case and as much of a WHITE interior as I can get.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any feedback will be GREATLY appreciated!"

"**Description of the Problem:**

In our environment, we have observed that after every restart of our Hyper-V VMs running on Microsoft Windows Server, CHKDSK checks are automatically initiated. Additionally, we have discovered corrupted files, some with a size of 0 kilobytes. This issue is occurring across multiple customers who utilize different hardware configurations, but all employ Microsoft Windows Server as the operating system and Hyper-V as the virtualization solution.



**Error Message:**

* ""A corruption was discovered in the file system structure on volume C:""
* ""A corruption was found in the file system index structure. The file reference number is 0x3000000049b62. The name of the file is ""\\Windows\\assembly\\NativeImages\_v4.0.30319\_64\\Microsoft.Mf49f6405#\\617020824902449651dee5c5c72f3d79"". The attribute of the corrupted index is "":$I30:$INDEX\_ALLOCATION"".""



**Possible Causes:**

1. Compatibility Issues: There may be compatibility issues between Hyper-V and certain versions or configurations of Microsoft Windows Server.
2. Faulty Configurations or Updates: Incorrect configuration settings or incomplete/incorrect updates could be causing problems with file storage and integrity.
3. Resource Exhaustion or Overload: It's possible that the VMs are not allocated sufficient resources such as CPU, RAM, or disk space, leading to malfunctions during data writes.



**Recommended Actions:**

1. Check Hyper-V Configuration: Ensure that Hyper-V configurations adhere to best practices and do not conflict with the Microsoft Windows Server environment.
2. Investigate Microsoft Windows Server Installation: Examine the Microsoft Windows Server installations for configuration errors or faulty updates and rectify them if necessary.
3. Optimize Resource Management: Monitor and optimize resource allocation for the VMs to ensure they are adequately sized and not causing overload.



4. Consult Microsoft Support: If necessary, reach out to Microsoft Support for specific recommendations and solutions to address the issue.



**We are also actively searching in internet forums and community discussions for similar problems and potential solutions. Any assistance or insights from other professionals would be greatly appreciated.**"
"Hello everyone, hope everyone is doing well. 

So, I was tasked with hardening certificate templates currently being distributed in a certificate authority.  

In order to not disrupt production systems,

1. I duplicated all vulnerable certificate templates. 

2. Worked on the duplicated template. Hardened. 

3. Confirmed with security that those vulnerabilities on those duplicate certificate templates were remediated. 

&#x200B;

Now what is the best way to replace the current certificates in production? 

Can I supersede the production certificates using the new Hardened certificate templates. 

How does this work exactly? Can someone elaborate? Is it possible to add them to the new hardened templates, supersede them and when the old certificate template expires it get renewed with the new hardened template. 

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

"Hello guys! I ll have a job interview next week and i need to have some knowledge on Windows Server 2019 and Microsoft Active Directory, those things being:
-Installing, administration and configuration of Microsoft Windows Server 2019
-Administrating and configurating  Microsoft Active Directory (creating and administrating of users, computers, groups and Organizational Units (OU), rights and permissions of users)
-Network services from Microsoft Windows Server 2019 in an Active Directory domain :catalogue - Active Directory -ADDS, printing (Print Server), files - DFS, infrastructure - DNS, DHCP
-Configurating Microsoft Windows 10 in a Microsofr Windows Active Directory 
(I need to mention that english is not my firsr language, so i translated those requirements from my native language, i hope you guys know what i am talking about).
 I had 2 books which i had to check: first being Windows Server 2019 & PowerShell all-in-one, Sara Perrot (found this one as PDF format, yet i didnt quite understood the information presented there) and Mastering Windows Server 2019 Second Edition, Jordan Krause (i couldnt find this book neither on the internet,nor in any stores). I also need to mention that the interview will be a written test, based on questions with multiple choices, so i need some resources that can cover both theoretically things about those programs and practical ones. Thank you guys in advance!"
"Edit: thanks y'all. I just started my windows server class for my degree yesterday so this is entirely new to me. Here's hoping I do good! 😊👍

Hiyya! I have probably the stupidest question ever. I'm reading ""Hands On Microsoft Windows Server 2016"" by Micheal Palmer for my college class. I have a little bit of experience in data centers from an internship I did and I spotted something that surprised me. 

For the Windows Server 2016 data center edition, it says it can only handle 64 CPU sockets. Doing some quick math from my own experience assuming dual slots per motherboard and 10 servers per rack, that only manages a little over three racks and many server motherboards actually have four meaning you only have two racks. 

So my question is, am I reading and comprehending this right? For the standard edition I could understand only having at max 2 racks, but for the  ""data center edition"" that seems really small. Anyways let me know if I'm an idiot haha, thanks so much!"
"I ran extensive RAM, GPU, CPU and ""verifier"" device driver stress tests against this machine and it does not crash. However, when I run the following scenario I am able to reproduce a UNEXPECTED KERNEL MODE TRAP on demand. The top of the stack in the dump file contains:

ntoskrnl.exe
hal.dll
kd.dll
mcupdate_AuthenticAMD.dll

all of which are authored by Microsoft, which lead me to believe that Microsoft's own drivers are crashing.

I will provide you with detailed hardware information but I don't believe the hardware is relevant at all (aside perhaps from the M6000 hub).

Environment:

* Microsoft Windows \[Version 10.0.19042.630\]
* Zoom 5.4.1
* Dell M6000 hub (firmware version A03, DisplayLink driver 10.0.82.0)
* Left monitor: LG 27UL550-W
* Right monitor: LG 27UD58
* Motherboard: MAG-X570-TOMAHAWK-WIFI
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
* RAM: F4-3600C18D-64GVK
* GPU: NVidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti (NVidia device driver 457.30)

Repro steps:

1. The left monitor is connected to the video card using an HDMI cable. It is set to ""4k x 2k, 3840 x 2160"" @ 29Hz. The Desktop color depth is 32-bit. The Output color depth is 8 bpc. The output color format is RGB. The output dynamic range is Full.
2. The right monitor is connected to the Dell M6000 hub using a DisplayPort cable. It is using resolution 3840x2160 @60Hz, 8-bit color depth, RGB color format, ""SDR"" output dynamic range. It is plugged into input port 1 of the hub.
3. Windows is configured to use the right monitor as the main display.
4. Disconnect the hub from the PC (the right monitor is still connected to its input).
5. Start Windows. Only the left monitor should be visible because the hub is disconnected from the PC.
6. Launch a Zoom video chat session with a remote participant waiting.
7. Plug the hub into the PC. The monitors will flicker a couple of times and eventually the main desktop and Zoom will get moved from the left to the right monitor.
8. To reproduce the BSOD simply hit the following keyboard combination over and over again while the screen is still flickering: WindowsKey + Up, WindowsKey + Left arrow key.

I know it sounds odd but this is the only way I have been able to reproduce this crash and it happens 100% of the time when I follow these steps.

My guess is that there some sort of race condition between Windows trying to move the video chat from the left monitor to the right (because the right monitor corresponds to the main display) and the user attempting to move the video in the opposite direction.

You can download the corresponding minidump [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zDNUtiveq2twZ20JDCFwt5SdKzz3rJcR/view?usp=sharing). Please let me know how to proceed to debug this further. Thank you.

**UPDATE**: The bug might be in (or triggered by) the NVidia device drivers. I am not able to reproduce the crash in version 445.87 but version 457.30 does. This isn't strictly an apples to apples comparison because the newer driver uses a refresh rate of 29Hz while the old one uses 30Hz. Still, this sounds like a pretty strong hint that NVidia's drivers are at fault. Here is a [full kernel dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mALA1Q39-ArXfoBuIWIbQvTLaTjhL6aS/view?usp=sharing) (156MB zipped) for your review.

**UPDATE2**: I've been able to reproduce the crash without Zoom and without fiddling around with the hub (connecting/disconnecting monitors shortly before the crash). I once logged into windows from the lock screen, hit WindowsKey+Up, WindosKey+Left and the blue screen occurred. It is much harder to reproduce this crash without Zoom, but it happens. I've also gotten the crash with the left monitor connected to DisplayPort so this issue doesn't seem to be specific to HDMI connections.

NVidia drivers are the usual suspect in these kind of crashes so I've reported a bug report to them but they haven't been unable to figure it out yet."
"There are widespread reports of the Start Menu and taskbar not functioning on PCs that have updated to todays new release of Windows 11, build 22000.176 for Beta/Release Preview channels, and 22449 on Dev channel. It also may affect older versions too as some commenters have mentioned. If you are on Windows 11 and your Start Menu and/or taskbar is not loading right, crashing, missing all the icons/clock, and otherwise being useless, you have come to the right place. 

The issue is being investigated and is listed in the known issues, and they have acknowledged it on Twitter too. 

>We're investigating reports across our Dev & Beta Channels that Start and Taskbar are unresponsive and Settings and other areas of the OS won't load. We appreciate your patience as we investigate. Please Stay tuned for more details.

Microsoft is reporting the issue is resolved, the  and shouldn't affect anymore PCs, and ""we will be rolling out a new server-side deployment that will automatically fix Insiders in this state over the next few hours.""



If you are still having trouble with this, here are a few different methods that appear to be helping others resolve the issue:

-----

##Official fix from Microsoft##


Recently, Windows Insiders in both the Dev and Beta Channels began reporting that Start and Taskbar were unresponsive and Settings and other areas of the OS wouldn’t load. We quickly discovered an issue with a server-side deployment that went out to Insiders and canceled that deployment. If you were impacted by this issue, you can use the following steps to get back into a working state on your PC.

* Step 1: Use CTRL-ALT-DEL and choose to open Task Manager.

* Step 2: Choose “More details” at the bottom of Task Manager to expand Task Manager.

* Step 3: Go to “File” and choose “Run new task”.

* Step 4: Type “cmd” in the “Open” field.

* Step 5: Paste the following: `reg delete HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\IrisService /f && shutdown -r -t 0`

* Step 6: Hit enter, and then your PC should reboot. After rebooting, everything should be back to normal.
Additionally, we will be rolling out a new server-side deployment that will automatically fix Insiders in this state over the next few hours.

**Below are unofficial fixes reported by others that worked for them**


You can uninstall the latest update by doing ""Ctrl + Alt + Delete"" taking you to your lock screen where you can select ""Task Manager."" Once Task Manager starts click ""File"" then ""Run New Task."" Then type in ""Control Panel"" and wait for that to open. Once it does, click in the left panel ""View Installed Updates."" Then find Update for Microsoft Windows (KB5006050) and uninstall.

So,

* Ctrl + Alt + Delete

* Blue screen with Lock, Switch User, Sign Out and Task Manager

* Select Task Manager

* Click File

* Click Run New Task

* Type in Control Panel - Click Ok

* When Control Panel opens, click the link in the left panel labeled ""View Installed Updates""

* Find update ""Update for Microsoft Windows (KB5006050) and uninstall it.

* Reboot

Thank you /u/Ag3nt0rang3_ for this.

Change your date to some time in October and disable time sync

* Open task manager

* Run, then type in Control and hit OK

* Select date and time

* Change date and time, then pick something in the future, hit OK

* Go to the Internet Time tab and disable the automatic sync.


Note! I've seen comments that simply changing the time sync server from Windows to NIST helped without having to adjust the clock itself. Worth a shot.

----

Run System Restore:

* Open Task Manager with Ctrl Alt Delete

* Run New Task 

* Then Type in CMD and make sure you check the box that says create as admin task. 

* When CMD starts type in rsutil.exe which starts up Windows Restore and set it back to before today's date.

----

Registry key fix 

* Use CTRL+Shift+Esc to Task Manager, run regedit as task.

* I went to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell\Update\Packages` and created a DWORD by name `UndockingDisabled` with a value of 1 [then restart your PC]. 

(The start menu didn't work, but at least now I can wait for the bug to be fixed from the Win11 taskbar.) To undo, Delete DWORD Value to restore Win11 explorer. I can see Settings by clicking on Taskbar and selecting Taskbar Configs.

----

Another way to do that registry key fix:

Open a command prompt as an administrator, and type the following command:

    reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell\Update\Packages"" /v ""UndockingDisabled"" /d 1 /t REG_DWORD /f

That is all I have for fixes at the moment, I'm still trying to read everything, and will keep adding more as I find them. You guys have posted over 300 comments in about an hour between this thread and others, they are coming in faster than I can read them but I am trying to at least look at everything."

If you want to post your hardware and what visual results you're getting, use a template so your comment is easier for others to find. Copy/paste this into the post box and fill it in.

    **CPU:** cpu @ speed
    **GPU:** gpu(s) 
    **RAM:** GB

    **Settings:** low, med, high, ultra, etc
    **Resolution:** 
    **Avg FPS:** 
    **Miscellaneous:** crashes, stutters, glitches, runs A-OK, etc

You don't have to use it and you can add to it and elaborate, but having this at the top of your comment will make it easier to find for others.

### Important Note

The mod team has been following all of the news and drama surrounding No Man's Sky, and we've been reading the other threads. We've noticed some folks getting nasty with one another. Please try to be respectful to other posters, regardless of your feelings about No Man's Sky or its developers. You can think No Man's Sky is the biggest joke/scam of 2016, or perhaps your favourite game of 2016, without being jerks to each other.

Whining about people pre-ordering or saying you pity them isn't constructive. It's the same argument every time and it devolves into the same slap fights. You might actually feel that way, but you're baiting for a fight. We're actively removing those comments here so folks can actually talk about the game.

Have fun and enjoy the game! Or don't!

"In 1998 documents leaked at Halloween about Microsoft deepthroating the open source community, especially GNU Linux. Microsoft for example has employees at even currently today with people paid by Microsoft to divide Linux users at for example YouTube or Facebook with the message Linux is bad. Those paid trolls are usually busy destroying Linux from the inside. The initial developer of SystemD for example thought it were Linux developers collecting Bitcoins to send a professional Hitman. These examples in the Halloween documents are still relevant today. 20 years ago in my country even showing people a running Linux system meant immediately termination of jobs and computer store owners especially in Belgium and the Netherlands went to prison for trying to sell Linux outfitted computers or laptops. I've lost 3 friends to afterlife just because their computer store sold a Linux system instead of the usual allowed back then Microsoft Windows systems. They Epsteined themselves unfortunately legally by law. In best case computer store owners went bankrupt by Microsoft and the BSA software alliance. Imagine a store getting all Microsoft products declared illegal to sell, because just selling 1 laptop with Linux. Some did survive though."

Hi there, I want to add Microsoft Windows SDK in my existing WPF project. Now comes into the story that why I need it? Actually, I have an existing WPF project from my office, where Windows SDK is already been there and that project is working as expected.

But I am unable to add this Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref in my new WPF project. Actually, In my project I need to implement this 

    using Windows.Devices.Display;
    using Windows.Devices.Enumeration;

  
That's why I want to add Microsoft Windows SDK in my project but don't find a proper way to do this. At first I think I should add it through NuGet Packages but that's not the ultimate solution.

  
I attach an image of my office WPF project where it's beautifully placed inside **""Frameworks""** sub folder under **Dependencies.** 

I want to implement that specific way, hope you people understand.

  
If anyone please know how to add, then please help."
"I am helping someone configure their iMac  to maximally protect their personal and work privacy. The Mac will soon be running Sonoma MacOS.

I'm normally an experienced Linux user and not too familiar with MacOS. I've used it and an iPhone a bit.

The user needs to run Adobe software for their work (bleah). That said, I am certain that running CC on a Mac is going to be more private than running it on Windows 10/11.

But I am also familiar with Apple's less-than-stellar approach to protecting privacy.

The user is not engaged in the Apple ecosystem nor wants to be. They run the Firefox browser with uBlockOrigin and tight privacy settings. They (prefer to) use DDG and LibreOffice and a private email system. The Mac is mostly seen as a more private alternative to Microsoft Windows.

They have a decent privacy-protecting stance to start IMO.

**What else can they do to reduce or eliminate Apple telemetry and data collection (even if encrypted) and other privacy invasions on MacOS?**

To start, I reviewed and implemented the recommendations in this article:

[How to stay as private as possible on the Mac](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1640877/how-to-stay-as-private-as-possible-on-the-mac.html)

I did not find anything much on PrivacyGuides or elsewhere on DDG. What am I missing? Are there any DNS blocking rules(sets) I should add to the pi-hole in use by their Mac?

Also, before I install Sonoma, any pointers to how to do a full, clean install on the drive? It is a used computer from a reputable business that sold it directly after they upgraded to a newer Mac. it is unlikely to have been tampered with.

Thank you for your advice Apple peeps!"

####Xbox Achievements 90/100

[Link to Review](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/alien-isolation-xbox-one/review/)

> A tough, terrifying and ultimate thrilling game that’s defiantly old-school in its approach. The result is one of the best survival horror games in recent memory.


####Official Xbox Magazine UK 9.0/10

[Link to Review](http://www.totalxbox.com/81645/reviews/alien-isolation-xbox-one-review/?page=1)

> Unique stealth-horror thriller that combines great pacing and smart design with razor-sharp AI that's unpredictable in all the right ways. It's an arduous undertaking, but it begs to be experienced.


####GamesBeat 83/100

[Link to Review](http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-is-the-most-merciless-game-of-2014-review/view-all/)

> Beyond tools, save points, and modest firearms, you absolutely cannot underestimate the importance of Alien: Isolation’s sound. Just like the art direction, the music offers the same kind of fan-pleasing connective tissue to Ridley Scott’s film.


####EGM 8.0/10

[Link to Review](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/egm-review-alien-isolation/#)

> Alien: Isolation might not deliver the scary, intimate experience players expected for its entire running time, but smart design, good pacing, and a ton of gameplay variety more than make up for the lack of chills. 


####Game Informer 7.8/10

[Link to Review](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/alien_isolation/b/xboxone/archive/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review-game-informer.aspx)

> Tense, certainly, and I jumped at more than a few surprise xenomorph encounters, but the environments and action fail to instill the sense of dread that the movies or other horror games have inflicted on fans. Despite taking more than its share of inspiration from the Alien series, I found Dead Space to be scarier than Isolation, even if playing through the genuine article is far more appealing.


####Polygon 6.5/10

[Link to Review](http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/3/6142209/alien-isolation-review-xbox-one-PS4)

> Alien: Isolation seems content to appear as a collage of borrowed elements from the films, with nothing new or original to say or show, eager only to get to the next reference. 


####Gamespot 6.0/10

[Link to Review](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alien-isolation-review/1900-6415897/)

> Alien: Isolation provides us a glimpse into a future that holds the Alien game you've always wanted. It is not, however, the vessel that carries you there.


####IGN 5.9/10

[Link to Review](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review)

> Someday, someone is going to make an incredible Alien video game that checks every box. But, sadly, Isolation is not it.

Now it's your turn. Let's see what you think of the game. If you want to give it a score? Go ahead!"
"[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars_3:_Dimensions)

>Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions is a 2014 multidirectional shooter video game developed by Lucid Games and published by Activision under the Sierra Entertainment brand name. The game was released on November 25, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, on November 26, 2014 for Xbox 360 and Xbox One and in the middle of 2015 for iOS and Android.[1][2][3][4] Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions is the first Sierra video game not to be owned by their former owner Vivendi. It is the sixth installment in the Geometry Wars series, and the first one developed after the creator of the series Bizarre Creations was shut down by Activision.

**So 3 years out, what is everyone's thoughts on the game now?** 

When the game was released, [it got high praise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2nfy0n/geometry_wars_3_dimensions_review_thread/) both by game reviews and gamers on Reddit. However, after the initial release, there hasn't been much discussion of the game aside from [when the Xbox 360 version game became backwards compatible](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/68u03w/geometry_wars_retro_evolved_2_and_geometry_wars_3/) with the Xbox One 6 months ago. For example, I wasn't able to find news on Reddit of the [free content update](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/04/01/geometry-wars-3-evolved-free-update/) (AKA, no microtransactions at all) the game got in 2015. And the two subreddits for the game have less than 200 subscribers combined (/r/Geometrywars and /r/GeometryWars3).

I think this is all a shame because the game is absolutely amazing but many of the levels/modes seem to have been played by relatively few people. The game's design and sound make it as addictive as gambling at a casino but without the actual gambling found in more recent games.

**Did it live up to your expectations?**

**Do you still play the game?**

**If you haven't gotten the game yet, is it on your wishlist?**

**What are your thoughts on the 3D levels?**

**Where do you want to see the franchise move forward?**"
"I have a few WSL2 linux instances I use for various things. Recently whenever I attempt to start any of them, doing so will cause either a  DRIVER\_IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL bluescreen referencing dxgkrnl.sys or the machine will spontaneously restart.

I start these from the windows terminal application in a new tab, and sometimes it looks like it's going to actually do something (and I even get to a command prompt sometimes, but if I do the machine will bluescreen or restart right after it comes up).  I suspected a problem with my nVidia drivers, so I removed them and did a clean install of the newest ones available for my 1080 video card (546.33) but it hasn't helped any.

`Windows Information:`

`OS Name: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro`

`OS Version: 10.0.19045 N/A Build 19045`

&#x200B;

Until I can get this fixed I'm back to using virtualbox VMs for my work. Which works, but isn't really ideal. I'd be very interested if anyone has any suggestions on what to try."
"Hi, 

I'm trying to install WSL 2 (in order to be able to use docker). I think I have followed all the steps [described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install#enable-the-virtual-machine-platform-optional-component-and-make-sure-wsl-is-enabled) but it's not working. When I run 

    wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2

or 

    wsl --set-default-version 2

I get this message:

> Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.

I've done the previous steps, including running these commands in an elevated Powershell:

    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

**Edit:** After running these commands my computer refused to boot. Startup repair fixed it but I believe it in doing so it has rolled back the effects of these commands.

I have confirmed I have virtualisation enabled (I checked the performance tab of the task manager and it says **Virtualization: Enabled**)

I am running Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19536.1000].

Googling the problem, it turns out someone has posted on github [with a seemingly identical issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4766). Unfortunately, he last posted 16 days ago that he did all the troubleshooting steps without success and no one has replied anything since.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly interested in your opinion on whether i should persist in fixing this issue or attempt to run docker with WSL 1.

***EDIT:*** Seems to be working now after I updated to the just-released Windows build 19551. I converted from WSL1 to WSL2 with no issues using the normal procedure."
"Hi!

My WSL Ubuntu does not work anymore.

My Windows system is: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044

&#x200B;

What I get when I run PowerShell as an admin:

    PS C:\Windows> wsl --install
    Der angegebene Dienst kann nicht gestartet werden. Er ist deaktiviert oder nicht mit aktivierten Geräten verbunden. PS C:\Windows> wsl Der angegebene Dienst kann nicht gestartet werden. Er ist deaktiviert oder nicht mit aktivierten Geräten verbunden.

(Meaning: *The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.*)

The same message for ""wsl"" and ""wsl --shutdown"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I have tried:

\- `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`

\- `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`

\- Downloading and running wsl\_update.

\- Checking that VM-Platform, Windows-Subsystem for Linux and Hyper-V in Features are indeed enabled.

\- Trying to start LxssManager in services. ""Start"" is gray, and Properties -> Auto results in a ""Zugriff verweigert"", meaning *access denied*. (I had a look at my partner's Windows 10 computer, if I do Services->LxssManager->context menu-Start there, Start is not gray and I can click it.)

Therefore I tried:

    PS C:\Windows> sc config LxssManager start=auto
    Set-Content : Es wurde kein Positionsparameter gefunden, der das Argument ""start=auto"" akzeptiert.
    In Zeile:1 Zeichen:1
    + sc config LxssManager start=auto
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [Set-Content], ParameterBindingException
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PositionalParameterNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetContentCommand

Meaning: *A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument etc. etc.*

\- Activating LxssManagerUser, where ""Start"" was not gray (without really knowing what is different to LxssManager).

\- Re-installing Ubuntu from the Windows Store does not work because it is already installed. If I try to start it, I get

    Installing, this may take a few minutes...
    WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80070422
    Error: 0x80070422 Der angegebene Dienst kann nicht gestartet werden. Er ist deaktiviert oder nicht mit aktivierten Gerõten verbunden.

(Again meaning that *the service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.)*

\- Trying to grant write permission for system32 because of the sc config LxssManager start=auto errror. It did not work, after granting permission I got an error while applying the attributes, access was denied.

\- Disabling Kaspersky

\- Scanning for malware (no results)

&#x200B;

What else coud I try?

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot in advance!"

"Hi All,

I wrote the following script recently because I wanted to have a quick an easy way to check whether a given Windows Server's Defender antivirus state is 'current' and up to date.  It checks the version of various components that make up the Windows Defender client on a machine and compares it to the version numbers of said components as retrieved by web-scraping from Microsoft itself.

It doesn't \*fix\* any issues on a Windows Defender installation on a client; but hopefully it spits out a summary of any issues to you the operator.

Requirements - Windows server or desktop running Windows Defender or its predecessor, Windows Forefront antivirus.  (I think Defender is basically the renamed Forefront)

    # Script performs 'web scraping' of a Microsoft page for downloading latest Windows Defender definitions, gathering data about the latest versions
    # of the Windows Defender components.  Uses that information to note what versions to expect on the local machine.
    # Script then queries the local machine WMI repository for Windows Defender information, compares to latest version information, reports to operator the overall status.

"Okay. here's the script. It's fairly straightforward. Take list of tables, loop through it calling a vendor-provided downloader for each one and log everything for each one while doing it.

    #Begin Loop
    #
    #
    #
    foreach ($table in $tables)
    
    {
    Set-Variable -name ""SyncDate"" -Value (Get-Date -format ""MM_dd_yyyy_HHmm"")
    #
    Start-Transcript -Path ""C:\app_logs\${table}_${SyncDate}_output.txt""
    #
    #Run sync command for $table
    #
    app --base-url $APP_API_URL --client-id $Env:CD_API_KEY --client-secret $Env:CD_API_SECRET --loglevel debug syncdb --namespace VendorName --table $table --connection-string $Env:LOCAL_DB_CONN_STRING
    
    Stop-Transcript
    
    }    

In all cases, I get separate transcript files for each table.

When this is called via task scheduler:

For the first two tables (in this instance ""shirts"" and ""ties"" I get a full log of everything ""app"" is doing. (It's a python SQL fetch)

I have tried configuring the task as 

powershell.exe

-NoProfile ""& ./app_automation.ps1""
with start in set to the folder the script is in.

I've tried it as 

powershell.exe 

""-File C:\app_logs\app_automation.ps1""

I've tried running as a user with privileges (works)
running as system (doesn't work at all)

I've tried putting a sleep statement inside the loop before the stop-transcript in case the app was having some kind of speed issue.

I've tried logging the whole loop to a single file. (start-transcript and stop-transcript outside the {} brackets)

I've tried logging with

    #try
    #{
    #	$proc = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start([System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo]@{
    #		Filename = ""app.exe""
    #		Arguments = ""--base-url $APP_API_URL --client-id $Env:CD_API_KEY --client-secret $Env:CD_API_SECRET --loglevel debug syncdb --namespace VendorName --table $table --connection-string $Env:LOCAL_DB_CONN_STRING""
    #		CreateNoWindow = $true
    #		UseShellExecute = $false
    #		RedirectStandardOutput = $true
    #	})
    #	$output = $proc.StandardOutput
    #	$output.ReadToEnd()
    #} finally {
    #	if ($null -ne $proc) {
    #		$proc.Dispose()
    #	}
    #	if ($null -ne $output) {
    #		$output.Dispose()
    #	}
    #}

In the hopes it would catch some kind of error message from the app. Nope.
.

.

.


**The only thing I can figure is that there has to be something fundamentally different between how ISE runs the script inside of it's own window versus how powershell instantiates an instance when it's called via task scheduler.**

.
.

That doesn't explain why it works twice and stops on the third via task scheduler. I put in the sleep so I could view the log start and stop timestamps, so I know it wasn't (and isn't without the sleep) trying to start three or more simultaneous app calls.

Log from task scheduler success:

I'm actually beginning to wonder if I'm ***also*** having an issue with the logging output here because some of the individual lines the python app is trying to log are long. Like, seeing a 400 column line is not unusual and there are several lines that are 1500+ characters long.

What's the single-line-length logging limit for start-transcript? Is that a buffer setting somewhere, or something? I don't see a parameter switch related to word wrapping or line length (or anything related to output formatting) listed for the cmdlet."
Hey guys I wanna play the game but I got a few questions to ask. How do you activate the windows 10 version and what’s the difference between it and the steam version? And for solo players is this game fun? Should I buy it now or wait for the update? Thank you in advance.

"Hi there, I want to add Microsoft Windows SDK in my existing WPF project. Now comes into the story that why I need it? Actually, I have an existing WPF project from my office, where Windows SDK is already been there and that project is working as expected.



But I am unable to add this Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref in my new WPF project. Actually, In my project I need to implement this

    using Windows.Devices.Display;
    using Windows.Devices.Enumeration;

That's why I want to add Microsoft Windows SDK in my project but don't find a proper way to do this. At first I think I should add it through NuGet Packages but that's not the ultimate solution.

I attach an image of my office WPF project where it's beautifully placed inside **""Frameworks""** sub folder under **Dependencies.**

I want to implement that specific way, hope you people understand.

If anyone please know how to add, then please help."

"I've been trying for a couple of hours. But, I can't find the .exe program file.

The ""readme.txt"" note doesn't really give a clue how to open it. 

It only states that it runs on Microsoft Windows and Mono.

The only thing I know is: it has been programmed in C#.

Am i missing any program or anything to run this application. (not a programmer btw)
