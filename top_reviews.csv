"I'm facing the battery issue. They said that the battery got deep discharge and they are telling me that I have to replace it with a new battery which cost around 60-70k. 

After some chit chat they told me that we can bear 50% cost of battery and you have to give 50%. I agreed to that so they did some paper work on which they wrote 50% and then wrote the amount which is 20,000. Exactly the day after tomorrow which is today they reached out to me via call "" your ola scooter is ready we had one battery already on our centre you can come and take your scooter"" and also one guy from the service centre told me that ola battery cost just dropped down 2 days ago.

Also I noticed that when we were doing the paper work one guy from the service centre was confirming 50%? really? customer agreed? and the other guy nodded him.

I feel like they just repaired the battery somehow or they are replacing it with the old battery and asking 20k for nothing. Feels like a scam to me."
"I have been a bit busy with some personal stuff so I wasn't able to post updates. And I probably will be busy for the next month. If anyone has any new info, articles, hands-on experience, second-hand experience about the Ola scooters please do share. 

We have recently crossed 70 members. Please share this subreddit with others on other social media. Especially with the numerous issues with the scooter and the company as a whole shaping every media story to suit them, I feel it very important we consumers have good communication with each other

The last info I received was that the final purchase window was opening soon

So please share any info you receive, the status of you're order, if you cancelled, why you did it etc. 

As always, take care

Cheers!"
"First of all, don't worry, your scooter is waterproof!

The Ola Scooter and the portable charger come equipped with an Auto Cut-Off feature, which shuts off charging once the battery reaches 100% charge.

Ola Scooters are designed to be charged with Ola's portable charger or at any Ola Hypercharger Station which will be set-up in over 400 cities across the country, with 100,000+ charging points.

Ola's portable charger has inbuilt surge protection of up to 6KV (for a few microseconds). It can handle a majority of scenarios related to voltage fluctuation. Even if voltage fluctuation goes beyond 6KV, the charger will automatically shut down. 
Now that's power!

Ola's Hyperchargers and portable chargers are designed with IP rating of IP55 and IP67 respectively; which means, come rain or snow, you can charge your scooter to the fullest! (Unless there's a blackout)

The Ola S1 Pro requires approximately 3.97KWh of electricity to get fully-charged, which means 3.97 units of electricity give you 181 km of range. The Ola S1 requires approximately 2.98KWh of electricity to get fully-charged, which means 2.98 units of electricity give you 121 km of range."

2. Ola Electric app: Do it all. Lock and unlock your scooter, check the charging status and range, pick a ride mode and much more - all from your smartphone!

3. Vehicle Intelligence: The Ola Scooter auto-locks and unlocks based on how far or close you are to it. It also has Charging Notifications, Range Alerts, Get Home Mode, Cruise Control, Take Me Home Lights and a Find My Scooter feature.

4. Security Features: These include, Geofencing, Anti-theft Alert, and Vehicle Safety and Security Alerts.

5. Infotainment Features: Now play your music, check your messages and answer your calls, all from your Ola Scooter.

6. Cruise Control and Hill Hold features are available only on Ola S1 Pro.

"The Ola Scooter comes fitted with extra-wide 12 inch tyres (110/70-12) both in the front and rear.

What do you think?"
Please post any youtube reviews/first looks of ola scooter here
"Last night was one of the scariest experiences of my life. I was riding my Ola S1 X+ with my friend on our way to a friend's wedding when the scooter suddenly stopped working in the middle of a dark, desolate road. It was pitch black, and we were completely stranded with no help in sight.

I had to remove the fuse, put it back again, and restart the scooter multiple times just to get it to work temporarily. Despite all the effort, we couldn’t rely on it, so I had to call a friend to come pick us up. It was an absolute nightmare. 

Since day one, my experience with the Ola S1 X+ has been nothing short of horrible. Frequent issues, no reliable support, and to make matters worse, Ola refuses to refund or exchange the scooter. It’s like buying an invitation to disaster.

If you're thinking of buying an electric scooter, please buy anything but an Ola. Learn from my experience and save yourself the frustration and danger.

#OlaElectric #ScooterReview #DisasterWaitingToHappen"
"I am planning to buy a scooter under 1L and Ola X1 seems the perfect option
Tho I am a little hesitant because of reviews of poor quality, ola scooters burning, software glitches and bad after sales service. 
How much of this is true and can ola owner or ev owners in general share their experience on mileage, battery detoriation and safety? 
Thanks"
"I'm yet to receive a message from ola that the scooter is available for booking. I have also tried uninstalling and re-installing the Ola App as suggested by people on Twitter but to no avail. 

Also, where are people discussing the issues related to booking? I didn't find much discussion going on in Reddit or Team-Bhp except Twitter. Is there any forum like it is there for Ather?


Edit: Thank you. Finally, the option was enabled.
 
But ultimately didn't book. 

I had reserved a slot on the first day itself but was not interested in booking because of the unavailability of portable batteries.  A friend of mine  was interested and we thought will book for him but ultimately with the delay and so many glitches (Road tax was showing as 15K, delivery was dec end) he also lost interest and decided to wait for official reviews to come."
"Firstly, a thankyou to this forum as well as all the people I DMed and their quick responses on my random (read noob) queries :D

Review of sorts will follow after this 'journey' paragraph! 

Didn't how to ride a bike up until November. Wanted a bike since 2018 but simply wouldn't get it for various reasons. Have Lord Activa since 2009 though! 

Started serious research May/June 2023, had my eyes on:
MT-15
TVS Ronin
H'ness

Then, in September/October got to know about CB300R and immediately fell in love with the neo-retro looks. Research went on, took a test drive, and my oh my, the sheer acceleration was scary, the goood scary. However, it was just a 5 mins ride and yet I basically finalized it. 

Then, wanted a test drive of Duke250 too, loved the design, the metal tank as well as the finish and console! Dealership had no test drive available even after waiting for a month. 

Did hell lot of research on accessories for CB300R, parts availability and what not! 16th Jan I was going to the dealership to book and sign the papers. 
Then came the news that Vit250 and Svart250 have been launched with updated design! 

Was always a fan of these Swedish machines however the saddle height never let me consider it test riding it let alone buying (5'7 with added disadvantage of inseam) 
Now, with bigger bike, better console and lowered seat height  immediately made me reconsider my decision for CB (I know many people love the earlier pure cafe racer look of it). 

Enough story time, so booked it 2 weeks back, got it last week and here I am :) 

Pros:
1. Looks (subjective, however can't deny it does look pretty) 
2. Low RPM exhaust note
3. Buttons are tactile
4. Headlight seems good (rode 5ish KMs in the dark) 
5. Suspensions are okay (my reference point is Ola scooter and activa, so take it with a grain of salt) 
6. Console info is good

Cons:
1. Engine heating? (Is it normal?, max temp I've seen is 97) 
I can feel heat on my thighs and knees
2. Idk why but handlebar looks very little tilted to left while riding (now this again can be my posture, seems perfect on standstill) 
3. Quite short gear ratios so 1st/2nd shift is quite often (I knew this beforehand) but since very new didn't know how often actually it will be) 
4. Husqvarna website earlier had mentioned officially that Bluetooth connectivity is there. For a month or so, was on their page, it is NOT there and I guess recently they removed it. 
5. Of course no extra market accessories yet. 

Others:
1. Haven't tested mileage properly, console shows 27 as of now. 
Mostly rode in city and normal traffic conditions 

More updates and pictures with better background should be coming soon. 
Until then ask away!"
"I have test drived ola s1 air , chetak urbane, aether 450s . All three had 1.3~ lakh onroad price . I really liked riding ola but due to the reviews I chose chetak . Because chetak without tecpac is still usable while aether without propack is unusable. But today ola got a price drop . So I am again confused.

Is ola scooters that bad? Especially the current gen?"
"Even if it doesn't have any defects, it looks gayish."
"Recently my sibling bought ola s1 x+ and within 2 month of use, it started having problems like display turning fully off when driving and all. So we raised a ticket and the appointment date was 8 days later available in our locality. The issues were fixed but after a week a new problem has occurred where we can’t use any buttons due to which the scooter doesn’t start and the guy at ola service is refusing to take a look at it saying get an appointment first and appointment isn’t available in our locality in next 7-8 days. I’m thinking of going there and having an argument with the service guy. What else can i do to speed up this?"
"Hi
I was riding my OLA scooter (S1X+). yesterday and suddenly the scooter died - the screen went off and the power also went off.

I was not able to start the vehicle again.

Has anyone faved something like this?

Is there anything i cold so to aolve this?"
I’m starting college in a bit and i needed something to get around. Daily commute is around 30 km and maybe 20 extra going to meet friends and what not. Needless to say i’ll need a fair mileage and preferably a little sporty. Friends suggested the MT-15 and it’s sporty twin but im not a fan of either. And owing to my size i feel that i’d be looking big on the the MT.
"Just what the title says. budget is 1.5Lakh. Looking to buy it for my mother and myself. I just know NOT to buy OLA scooter.

Looking for daily commute as well as long commute sometimes. 

Things that i am looking for with priority:

1. Good Servicing & customer care.
2. No unnecessary trouble.
3. Battery should be good & should charge fully over night.
4. Good range? ( daily commute is fine )

Any suggestion will be helpful."
"Got my CB350 Delivered this evening, after months of consideration, test rides and reddit discussions. Thanks a lot folks for clearing out my doubts!

Bigger challenge ahead: Sending my Ola Scooter 3000 kms away."
"Bro got butthurt  when LinkedIn took his post about pronouns down. Now he wants all Indians who didn't have much of a problem with Microsoft owned LinkedIn to boycott it. Zoho founder too has joined hands with him as they think MS is a bully. 

He's a Jai Shankar of the Corporate. 

After Ola scooters and Krutrim AI that is gonna take on Chatgpt( :P), bro might have OLA OS as a  replacement for Windows."
https://twitter.com/SamkitP21/status/1617034354437545985?t=WzmULliZ7NESOtyAaQ-sJg&s=19
Mine just stops working even when it has 50% of charging left.
"I have bought an ola scooter which is to be delivered by 3rd week of July. Today I received a call from some number asking for FAME-II OTP. I feared that it's a scam call and immediately cut the call (heard so many times about OLA OTP scam). Now they called me again, I just asked why should I even believe this call is genuine? They talked something about Pan card and something. My panic mode immediately struck and I immediately cut my phone. Now they repeatedly called, like 7-8 times. I just switched off my phone out of fear of being scammed. 

If someone has bought one from ola or knows anything, please help."
OLA Service issue. Customers are kings and they will decide the fate of the company.
"My investment philosophy is a mix of being contranian, and allow a bit of risk when the reward is high. I don't believe in doing too much research, because there's no way you can predict a success like Zomato. You can just hypothesize and hope for the best. Reasons for investing in Ola Electric:

1. Electric 2W make way more sense electric cars in India (since distance covered are short) and we are still early in the transition.
2. It's possible that EV complaints for Ola scooters are overblown or[ they will address it with time](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/ola-electric-customer-complaints-issue-ccpa-to-probe-ola-electrics-99-complaint-resolution-claim-452044-2024-10-30).
3. Ola electric has the highest market share and a decent product portfolio. They can go very well from here.

So, in a few months, Ola Electric can either fall down quite a bit if they lose market share and fail to regain trust of customers. Or, they can reach their old highs and go even further than that if they maintain their market dominance.

Happy to take this bet."

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**

  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  
**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28."
"I don't defend OLA but why so much hate?
Yes its a startup there will be bad products and there will be hickups. Then just don't buy their product.

On kunal kamra controversy, bhavish is just saving his company's image by defending it. Yes he will make noise thats what is called promotion to create hype, create publicity. But why are we abusing him many people were making money after ipo for quite sometime.

To those who are showing falling stockprice of Ola. Market is all red so i don't think ola is at fault, it was all market hype which increased ola's stock price the price is still at IPO level (if not above it considering market is all bearish)

I think there is a direct comparison to Chetan Bhagat, his novels are not that good but you cannot  deny they are simple reads. Yes they have p*rn but only a small part of it (so do bollywood). But many people hate him so much? Why they hate him? Just don't read him likewise don't buy OLA scooter. Use ola app its ok in my opinion gets the job done. As a CEO he has made OLA (app) sucessful, he might not have it in him to build a electric vehicle brand so be it. He will fail, just don't buy ola scooter. But most people are buying it even after so much news of fire and what not.
Given he has made a copy of a cab hailing app he is again trying to copy the electric vehicle brand by copying Elon Musk. He is intelligent in my opinion because certainly his trick is working because at the end no publicity is bad publicity. Elon Musk was getting so much hate when he bought Twitter amd i don't think it bothers anyone now.

Here are just my two cents just opinion no support to ola.

At the end haters yahi reh jayenge usko traction aur publicity de kr and vo udhar paisa bana lega imo."
"If you ask Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar  Sharma, he'll tell you that this isn't the best time for a startup to go public. However, there is never a bad time to approach VCs for funding.

Bhavish Agarwal, co-founder, and CEO of Ola, just posted a.png file on Twitter that appears to be a render of an electric car.

Since Bhavish's post, Ola Electric has raised 11.8k likes, 1258 retweets, and 1243 comments.

Ask Elon Musk what's better than going into the car manufacturing industry. Despite the fact that he was sleeping on factory floors and was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy twice. But the good memes eventually paid off, and Tesla is now a trillion-dollar company.

Bhavish immediately responded when many business experts advised him to focus on his Ola scooter issues first. ""These petrol journalists are terrified of our Twitter likes my electric car got,"" he said.

VCs are apparently debating whether or not to fund Ola's electric car project until the tweet receives at least 50k likes on Twitter.

"1. The Stock hit a high of 3584 at Feb 16 2021 and is now trading at 2485/share which is a fall of more than 30% from ATH.
2. The YoY sales growth has decreased by 10% . The decrease in sales can be attributed to  regulatory changes in emission norms, rise in Petrol price and people opting for Electric bikes instead.
3. As per estimates, I expect even more decrease in sales due to price hike of raw materials and fear of Omnicron variant which might cause a bad look in its P/L statement. But as investors, we have to remember that a company is valued depending on its growth and Hero Motocorp has a huge value to be unlocked - ""E2W market"".
4. Right now, Ola electric is likely to dominate the E2W market in 2023 because of its gigafactory in TamilNadu that will produce 1 crore ola scooters/year which will likely put the numbers produced by its competetors Okinawa, Ampere and Hero Electric to shame.
5. By creating 1 crore E2W's per year, this will cause a massive spike in charging infrastructures in Metropolitican hubs like Delhi, Banglore, Chennai, Calcutta that can be easily exploited by Hero Motocorp as the present market leader.
6. As of today, Aether motocorp which is backed by Hero Motocorp is creating its second manufacturing factory in Tamilnadu that will create 4 lakh E2W vehicles per year. Adding it with inhouse production of E2W Splendor from March 2022, Hero motocorp has a huge possibility to become #2 Market leader in E2W space within 2025. 
7. These factors can easily make the stock rise to its previous ATH of 3584 giving investors a profit of 44% in the next few years."
"About: Ather and Ola are Indian companies manufacturing electric vehicles. I own an Ather and I'm interested in knowing what data is collected from the vehicle and how to evade from that. 

As a privacy enthusiast and an advocate, I'm interested in learning about the data collection practises of electric vehicles.
Given that Ather and Ola are the most popular electric vehicles in the country, I've learnt that they collect a ton of data about you.

Like, I've an Ather, and it has 46+ sensors installed onto the vehicle and I've no idea about what sensor collect what data and where does it share, I cannot control the internet in the vehicle, it is always connected to the internet, I cannot block the network access unless I shut it down. The same is with the Ola scooters as well.

(I was able to block the telemetry from the app just because I can control it, not the vehicle. I physically own it, not virtually.)

I tried searching about this on the internet and I'm astonished by the fact that I couldn't find, not even a single post or an article that addresses this privacy issue in these electric vehicles.
Yes, in the ather forum, I was lucky enough to find a thread addressing my concerns but all the questions went unanswered.

I'm pretty sure that your live location is being shared with the company 24/7. I want to know more because I'm concerned. As a user, I've paid for the vehicle means I should own it. It is not that the OEM is supposed to be taking care of the vehicle. Of course it should, but it has its own limits and I, the user should be the decider and not the company.

P.S: I could only find 2 privacy policies. One on their website which talks about the data practices on the website. Another is regarding the app that talks about data practices on the app. Both of them are horrible in their own way. However, I could no where find a privacy policy for the vehicle (Ather 450x, to be specific)."
"Hello All , I have already put up a distress message on the St. Broseph south bangalore chapter , so hopefully they will help me with this issue. If you spot a Gray (anthracite) color vehicle with number KA \*\* EU 1411 , please inform me of the same.   
It will likely be somewhere in HSR layout , but at this point I have no clue.

On Monday morning I noticed that My OLA scooter was no longer in my ground floor parking garage but Gone . Missing. 

I panicked and have already lodged FIR with the police.  
The OLA scooter details are clearly visible on my ola app but I am unable to retrace it. My scooter is insured so I will try and contact OLA scooter helpline for help as well.

Please be a bit vigilant , Bangalore city , in helping me get my scooter back as my livelihood depends on me being able to shuttle to and fro , from my workplace , on a daily basis.

Please be of help"
"I  bought ola 8 months ago, due to personal reasons had to travel out of the city and put it in vacation mode when the battery was around 30%. Could only return after two months. Due to which the scooter got deep discharged. I was not aware this would happen, now they're charging close to 90k for battery replacement, as it can't be repaired. There was one auto generated call from ola which I didn't pick assuming it was spam call in that period.  During purchase the sales person had told put it in vacation mode but didn't mention anything about the deep discharge. 

Even towing experience to the service centre is so bad.  The folks in service centre are so overloaded that they don't pick up the calls and it was one of the worst service centre experiences I had ever been. I don't blame the service centre guys but looks like they're under staffed. 

This post is just for venting my frustration and you don't do the mistake I did. 


summary : ola scooter battery got deep discharged and there's no way to fix it, it has to be replaced.



*Update: Ola replaced my battery without cost, so thank my luck for that. However it ook close to 1.5 months.*"
"I faced a terrifying and unprovoked attack today while driving on Vibgyor High School Road in Bangalore. This seems like a planned attack to extort money.

Summary of the incident:

* A grey Ola scooter (KA 03 KU 6880) randomly overtook my car.
* The rider followed me, yelling and shouting, then obstructed my way.
* He picked up a coconut shell and smashed my window multiple times.
* A grey Renault Triber (KA 04 MW 2000) also tried to block my way further ahead.

Thankfully, I had a dashcam and recorded the entire incident. BLR Police reached out and shared that there's some update on the case. Filing a formal complaint soon.

More details, footage and real-time updates on Twitter - [https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761](https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761)

I hope things get better and more livable in this beautiful city.

PS: Unsolicited advice to all car owners, please install dual-channel dash-cam in your car ASAP. This is like paying for an insurance policy.

Update: The scooter guy is apprehended. Details here - [https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761](https://x.com/DJain1989/status/1797276640357277761)"
"Day before yesterday was my First day i spent in Bangalore as an adult , i have been here before when i was 14.

Now i felt i need a change in my life , so i wanted to move to Bangalore , so i came to look for jobs and give my cv.

I felt the city so energetic , every person around were so wholesome. Everyone around me were happy and smiling , i was so much excited to be in Bangalore.

So much youngsters from various parts of the nation , the culture was unique i travelled whole day in Bus only from Marathahalli to Malleswaram , Then to Bommasandra , Then to Bileshivale and back to Marathahalli

I got to meet many people and had  wholesome conversations with local uncles 

And the bus conducter marked that she didnt give 5 rs change , i thought its like a coupon so i can get discount in next bus but other conducter didnt even respond me when i asked.

Weather was so nice that day compared to my place , and finding the bus in majestic was hard too .

I went back to pg after tiring travel and slept peacefully , 


Second day i had an interview and i went , and to my surprise even security person was so fluent in english , we became good friends.

Later that day i had my train , my friend took me to a kerala restaurant in bellandur , i had to carry my trolley on my lap, sitting as a pillion.
 
I had my train at K.R.Puram , my friend didnt know routes properly , he missed the u turn and we went over benniganahalli bridge , we went close to 3 kms for the U turn

While returning back from there i never realised my day is going to face a u turn , from all the happy faces , joyful vibes of bangalore amidst the traffic.

My friend was guilty of not knowing the routes and i might have missed my train because of it , so he panicked a bit.

He was filtering through the traffic and when finally when we reached an open strech......

My trolley's wheel which i was holding on my lap , hit on an ola scooter person's handle
I realised it was about to hit and i tried to move it a little , but still it hit his hand , i waved him telling a sorry.

But that man was furious , he started chasing animatedly , screaming at us , my friend didnt realise it until i told him the situation.

That person came close to us and showered hindi bad words at us thinking we are north indian , but iam tamil

My friend slowed down the bike to speak and the person tried to push us down , we lost balance somehow my friend managed and stopped 

That person stepped down screaming at my friend and tried to slap him , i intervened and 
told him it was my fault , but he was not ready to listen 

He was so anxious that he might have died , but that was not so bad of a collision , it was minor , and he tried to tell in tamil to us that he have kids and family.

I understood his emotion and felt bad and also realised the psychological effect of being in so much traffic , ROAD RAGE.

He exaggerated the situation so much out of the anxiety i think.

And i my friend was so pissed and had a thought its common in bangalore when riding with Tamilnadu registered vehicle , which i have heard in many incidents 

But this was not like that and explained my friend not to have such a negative mindset which makes us feel insecure .

That person left and later i realised it was not the trolley wheel which hit his handle, it was my hand and i stumbled on that man's brake handle and i was bleeding.

We reached K.R.Puram station after all the hassle , we had a cup of tea and we were happy that we didnt escalate the problem . 

We both were so raged at the beginning wanted to fight that person , as that man confronted us when it was him who came and hit my hand , 

But during the arguement i realised that person was unaware of what happened , even i was not sure what happened all of a sudden

And my advice to anyone facing such issue dont plan to fight , just let them vent out verbally and leave, its better than arguing or fighting the person , which is not worth it

After having two contrasting days , i left the city with a smile .

Once i get some vacancy in job i will move.

I wanted to share my experience , and would love to hear similar situations , and how you faced it ?"
"* Ather has low range for my requirement. they will start to make it atleast 100 range I'll be first in line.
* TVS iQube checks lot of boxes but fails in Range and man feels like they intentionally made an inferior product just because they don't want to hurt their Jupiter sales. Charging time 7 hr are you kidding?
* Ola scooter: Don't want to be their unpaid beta tester 
* Hero electric is a Joke so much potential lost!!
* Others: Imported plastic body kits paired with retrofitting ev motor no underseat space to keep helmet

Feels like i should put off buying an ev for atleast 2 more years"
"I wonder if anyone else got the Ola EV scooter delivered to Mumbai?

I haven't seen a single Ola Scooter on-road in Mumbai yet."
